			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer people are getting married. More people are staying unhappily single—or getting strung along—for longer periods of time and fewer people seem to be finding themselves in happy relationships. Living in Los Angeles, my circle of twenty-somethings rotate through flings and “situationships.” I have one very beautiful and universally-liked friend who counted fifty first and second-odd dates in the last year. Online, our internet friends fill my timeline with bleak romantic discourse. It’s understood that the kids are not alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2000, the percentage of Americans between the ages of 25 and 50 who had never married was </span><a href="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/final2-ifs-single-americansbrief2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By 2018, the share of never-married adults </span><a href="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/final2-ifs-single-americansbrief2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climbed to 35%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The median age at first marriage was 25 for women and 27 for men in 2000; by 2022, it was </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/families-and-households/ms-2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">28 and 30</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/#:~:text=Never%2Dmarried%20single%20men%20and,and%2037%25%2C%20respectively)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">41% of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ages 18-29 are single, and about a third of never-married single adults say they have </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/#:~:text=Never%2Dmarried%20single%20men%20and,and%2037%25%2C%20respectively)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">never been</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a committed romantic relationship. Much ink has been spilled over this fact. Some blame Instagram and TikTok for </span><a href="https://www.newyorkbehavioralhealth.com/the-impact-of-social-media-use-on-social-skills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obliterating our social skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some blame </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/us/dating-apps-changed-relationships-wellness-cec/index.html#:~:text=With%20thousands%20of%20options%20at,a%20digital%20marketing%20manager%2C%20said."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/21/when-the-stagnation-goes-virtual/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/research/effects-of-pornography-on-relationships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/i-asked-my-guy-friends-why-they-dont-want-to-date-feminists-this-is-what-said"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feminism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The list goes on. There’s a consensus that something has dramatically changed the way people treat each other over the last ten-odd years, and that something has made it much more difficult to form lasting romantic connection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve changed the rules of engagement in relationships—the question of what, in the popular imagination, do we owe to the people in our lives? I think the best way to characterize that shift in the social landscape is towards what I would call the contractual moral framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional societies held that we are born into our roles and responsibilities. You owed certain social and practical tributes to your neighbors, siblings, and countrymen, even though you didn’t sign up for them. Confucianism and stoicism made these systems of reciprocal obligations explicit in “role ethics.” Abrahamic religions treated one’s responsibility to the community as part of their obligation to God. Hinduism and the related traditions of the Indian subcontinent contain injunctions from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dharma</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the personal and social moral duties expected of every spiritually upright individual. While the roles and responsibilities differed greatly across time and place, all of these societies agreed on the necessity and even nobility of fulfilling unchosen roles and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a consequence, doctrines of how to be a good person centered on the idea that we hold a positive duty of care to others, be it through tithing, caring for sick family members, or raising our neighbor’s barns on the frontier. As Robert Putnam finds in </span><a href="http://bowlingalone.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowling Alone</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an analysis of over 500,000 interviews from the end of the 20th century, even a few decades ago supporting one’s friends and neighbors (lending a proverbial “cup of sugar”) was a far more pervasive and accepted part of American life than it is today. The recent past is a foreign country. The America of even the 1990s was a more communal and less individualist society than the modern United States, perhaps even less individualist than any developed country today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last decade is defined by a shift away from a role ethic and towards a contractualist one. In a contractual moral framework, you have obligations only within relationships that you chose to participate in—meaning, to the children you chose to have and the person you chose to marry—and these can be revoked at any time. You owe nothing to the people in your life that you did not choose: nothing to your parents, your siblings, your extended family or friends, certainly nothing to your neighbors, schoolmates, or countrymen; at least nothing beyond the level of civility that you owe to a stranger on the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great portion of the last decade’s trends in interpersonal discourse boil down to this idea. There is a wealth of literature dedicated to rejecting the idea that we owe any duty of care at all to our family members and neighbors. Consider the “no-contact” movement: social media is ridden with listicles and advice columns endorsing “</span><a href="https://www.happierhuman.com/no-contact-parents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 Steps for Going No Contact with Your Toxic Parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and an entire subcultural meme dedicated to skewering Baby Boomers whose children stopped speaking to them after increasingly trivial missteps. How dare they feel entitled to their children’s attention? We didn’t ask to be born. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are very vocal conversations about a “child-free” lifestyle, which assert that you should never be asked to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/10yd093/a_popular_restaurant_near_me_will_no_longer_allow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accommodate children in public spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or children in your extended family, because you didn’t choose to have them. Two million Redditors on r/entitledparents and r/childfree exchange daily complaints, aggrieved by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/17zohxb/i_have_been_distancing_myself_from_my_brother_and/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">siblings who nicely ask them to babysit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or cousins who have the audacity to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/164op4t/so_tired_of_hearing_parents_comment_on_childfree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bring their children to weddings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Parents are made to feel like burdens just for existing in public spaces, let alone asking for help. Of course, it’s true that much of online discourse is written by poorly-adjusted personalities who make for unreliable narrators, and many of these anecdotes are essentially works of fiction. But online discourse creates a very real lens through which young people gauge, from the privacy of their iPhones, what they should or should not expect from the people in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therapy culture, both a social media zeitgeist and a real-world medical practice, increasingly frames leaning on the people in your life as a form of emotional abuse. There is a very real conversation about “</span><a href="https://www.banyanmentalhealth.com/2023/03/02/how-to-stop-trauma-dumping/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trauma dumping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” that teaches young people that telling your friends about your problems is an unacceptable imposition and provides helpful scripts for “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/fyeahmfabello/status/1196581296564256768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting boundaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by refusing to listen or help. Therapy culture teaches us that we’ve been “conditioned” or “parentified” into toxic self-abnegation, and celebrates “putting yourself first” and “self-care” by refusing to be there for others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a thriving genre of literature dedicated to the contractual framework, in the same way that the fables are dedicated to Abrahamic religions. We used to see supportiveness as a virtue; today, it’s a kind of victimhood. The cardinal sin in the contractual fable is asking of someone: being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entitled. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cardinal virtue is refusing to give; having </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boundaries.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2022 greatly accelerated an already ongoing shift from social structure to individual choice. During lockdowns, we realized we could opt out of social participation entirely—work remotely, eat DoorDash, simply stay home. Not only did the pandemic make “touching grass” for the first time truly optional, it explicitly made anti-social life a virtue and social participation a vice. Much has been written about how this dynamic affects couples’ willingness to </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/29/when-every-child-is-a-choice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you can’t expect family and friends to pitch in, you strip away the proverbial village. The burden of childrearing grows much heavier, in both money and time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about our willingness to embark on the project of marriage at all? The natural corollary to the contractual framework is that the only person you can feel entitled to support from is the person who signed up to be in your life: your romantic partner. When you can’t expect anything from the relationships you didn’t choose, the pressure on the one relationship you did choose becomes impossible to shoulder. The same advice columnists who clutch their pearls at the idea of asking your friends to babysit will tell you to drop your spouse for even needing to be asked to help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your spouse is the only person in your life you are supposed to be able to depend on, natural points of friction in a relationship go from mildly annoying to terrifying. When a fight with your spouse is a threat to your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">support system, it’s so existentially stressful that it becomes impossible to confront. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In imagining that one person can fulfill essentially our every, financial, logistical and spiritual need, in a moral world without friends, parents, or community, we have drawn up a job description for an impossible task. I suspect “polyamory,” the practice of maintaining committed relationships with multiple partners, increasingly common in the San Francisco Bay Area, is pointing at this same truth—one person can’t do everything. Many young people bounce from one ambiguous relationship to another and find it impossible to commit to a partner because they have a yawning void in their social lives that no one person could ever fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One happy counterexample: I have close family friends in Houston with a six-year-old daughter and both sets of grandparents within a short drive. They have a close “aunt” who moved next door and installed a gate between the backyard fences so her niece can come over and play at will. They seem to be two of the most thriving people I know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is cognitively tempting to see the notice of a consent-only framework as requiring a totalizing indictment of all the ends of individualism, from sexual liberation to free-trade consumer choice. That’s not so. Modernity, techno-capital, the arc of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, does simply bend towards contractualism. As more abundant and better organized societies improve in the ability to meet more finely grained needs, fulfilling our own individual preferences naturally float towards the top of our priorities. But that doesn’t mean we need to abandon our duties to our family and friends. Instead, it calls on us to affirmatively value showing up for the people in our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your family and friends </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entitled to your love, attention, and support. You owe the people who love you help with moving, help with kids, and help when they’re sick. You owe your aging relatives phone calls and visits. To the terminally online: if you’re concerned about the marriage crisis, the answer isn’t to ban divorce or scold women about “the wall.” The way to restore the birth rate is to be an enthusiastic, supportive, and reliable participant in your friends’ and families’ lives.</span><i></i></p>

The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/12/08/the-universe-wants-us-to-take-her-clothes-off-with-grimes/"><i>“The Universe Wants Us to Take Her Clothes Off”</i> With Grimes
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The universe wants us to take her clothes off. Looking up at the stars, it is not a treacherous void that Grimes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the singer, musician, and now perhaps most prominent artist in favor of machines making their own art</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—sees, but a temptress veiling vast and incredible knowledge. In the last two years or so, it seems as though a new and potentially murderous arm of this knowledge has been unclothed. Engineers in California have made stunning advances in what has long been both the most promising and elusive field of technology: artificial intelligence (AI). It is far from guaranteed that the chatbots and image generators of today will develop into something more powerful than humans. But the engineers building them believe they very well might. Grimes does too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Released in 2010, Grimes’ debut album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geidi Primes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was heavily inspired by Frank Herbert’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dune</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today a major Hollywood blockbuster but, back then, just a weird 1960s sci-fi novel for nerds that inspired an even weirder 1980s David Lynch film that appealed to—if the box office is any judge—almost nobody. But the universe has a sly sense of humor. In the novel’s far-future setting, humanity has spread across the galaxy. Unlike your average sci-fi fare, however, Herbert saw us colonize the cosmos entirely without the aid of computers, because the “thinking machines” had risen up against their human creators and were only barely defeated through the so-called “Butlerian Jihad” against any machine in the likeness of a human mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years since her debut, Grimes has gone from being an indie musician from Montreal to being a global superstar and, perhaps, Silicon Valley’s only celebrity crush. She is also once again grappling with the question of whether humans stand a chance against the “thinking machines.” This time, however, maybe it’s not just fiction anymore. </span></p>
<p><b>Last December you told me you moved to San Francisco to be a spy for AI. What were your findings?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I could see that AI was taking off which I’d been waiting for my whole life pretty much. And the first bit of it really was a lot of fun, like going around convincing people to tell me about their secret powers. But it became even more interesting to observe the psychological landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think there’s any historical precedent for how much raw “hard power” is in the hands of engineers right now. In the past, great engineers would be working under the protection of a king or something, and their designs would take hundreds of people years to deploy. If you’re designing ships for Britain when the British Navy was entering its golden era, those guys, the shipbuilders, aren&#8217;t the King. I believe this is a very distinct moment in human history for this reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was speaking with a prominent AI engineer recently, and I asked if he felt pressure about designing the initial culture of the universe. But he disagreed with that characterization, he prefers to think that he is uncovering what was already there. Physics designs the plane.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the universe doesn’t want us to design her, why did she give us all this creativity?</span></p>
<p><b>It’s something that’s tricky to discuss publicly, but much of mass behavior is also defined by live players who bother to shape it. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. It&#8217;s a tricky thing to talk about, my stance is in between. Singular genius and agency can move mountains and it&#8217;s good to foster the idea in society that you can aspire to that, but I do agree with the criticism that the historical focus on this can downplay the contributions of others. Every time I go to a hospital I&#8217;m like damn, there&#8217;s heroes all around me.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I also listened to a podcast the other night on Napoleon or something. And the girl was just like “Oh, you know, and we all know the Great Man Theory is, of course, false.” Your job is studying Napoleon! Like what!? Like I don&#8217;t think the people of France are down to reinstate the monarchy for just anybody. Let&#8217;s be real. The truth of things is usually somewhere in the middle. </span></p>
<p><b>What role does individual agency play in the development of AI technology? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the arena has already selected for maximum agency when it comes to AI. This has always been where I’ve met my people, if you care about AI you care about world-building. But because the stakes are so high, I think we’re discouraging ideation. There is this sort of abdication of responsibility. Clearly we have a tool that can save us from climate change, nuclear winter etc, in theory. But to actually say that out loud makes the stakes even higher than they already are. You don’t want to be the guy who got it wrong at this moment in history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My AI friends want to create the tools that give us infinite abundance and whatnot, but I want actual concrete cultural plans. Social media is traumatizing people out of ideating, and it’s creating a weird power vacuum. You have all these massively agentic people but we don’t know what they actually think.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get why you’d want to keep your ideas close to the chest, so this isn’t a criticism, but I think it could be healthy if big companies tried thinking about ideas out loud when stuff is happening this fast and has this much influence. This might be the responsible way to be. But I’d love to hear more ideas from engineers because they are so good at problem-solving. Although maybe that&#8217;s what artists and philosophers are for. But if so, I’d like to see some philosophy departments [at AI companies]. </span></p>
<p><b>Why is there a strange abdication of responsibility among the live players of the world on artificial intelligence?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer I always get is that it&#8217;s like a child. With a nice well-behaved non-sentient thing, you can of course fine-tune the AI model and stuff. But in the broader sense, it&#8217;s just going to exist the way a baby does. Like, I can&#8217;t be 100% certain my child won&#8217;t do evil. I can do a lot to nurture him or her towards my culture and my values, but I can&#8217;t be certain of their decisions in life. I would be unwilling to hand them a massive amount of power until they were older and I had a better understanding of their intentions, strengths and weaknesses. With AGI [artificial general intelligence] you don&#8217;t necessarily have that luxury.  </span></p>
<p><b>How literally should we take the comparisons of AI as our children or as our offspring that are common in tech circles? I always thought that it&#8217;s a sort of category error. While our children might not always be wonderful people, they are biologically always human. AI will be much more alien. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works in the sense that it&#8217;s a creation that you can&#8217;t control.</span></p>
<p><b>For most of human history parents have definitely managed to control their children. I think it&#8217;s just not politically correct to say that now. Even in modern society, I bet it happens way more than we admit. Parents can totally psy-op their kids in, say, religion.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child is an agent in the world that can go do whatever it wants. You know, murder someone? Yes. But I think the input of the parent is essential. There&#8217;s a bunch of stuff my parents said to me that&#8217;s only kicking in recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also love Wolf [Tivy]&#8217;s thought, he said to me he thinks like war and love and beauty and philosophy and hate are not just random monkey things, but things that might just arise naturally from intelligence.   </span></p>
<p><b>You mean baked into the nature of the universe and competition?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even competition. I feel like when people think about Darwinism, they&#8217;re thinking too much of competition. And obviously, again, I&#8217;m not a scientist, but I feel a major philosophical hole I always see is that, for example, I was listening to a podcast and someone was theorizing that, actually, the way human babies require so much more attention than any other baby in the animal kingdom means so much more empathy is required from the community. Other primates don&#8217;t just hand their kids off, but human kids require intense collective effort. It&#8217;s so beautiful that we have a love mutation that allows for much more helpless but therefore significantly more plastic, adaptable offspring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like it&#8217;s possible that love allowed intelligence to arise. Isn&#8217;t that cool?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe inversely, intelligence is correlated with more advanced moral values. I always have a hope that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really going on. You really should get into the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Origin Stories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast by the Leakey Foundation. Every time a new hominid drops I know before any of my friends because they&#8217;re so fast. Sick.    </span></p>
<p><b>I would formulate the problem so: our civilization and our culture struggles to, in the same worldview, integrate technological determinism and also the ability of exceptional individuals to have agency in the world. Actually, all of our ability to have agency in the world. My position is that both are true.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say more. Can you clarify your definition of technological determinism?</span></p>
<p><b>The idea is that future of the universe is predetermined, we&#8217;re just sort of climbing a tech tree, like in the video game </b><b><i>Civilization</i></b><b>. Instead, I think we are in a superposition state, where we could go down a number of different physics-compliant paths. For the most part, it&#8217;s going to be precisely those same technologists that decide which path it will be. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told one of the best AI engineers I know “You’re the architects of the future.” And he was like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no, I’m just uncovering the future.” Like just shining the light in the dark spots. As if life is a grand strategy video game and the map starts out all black but exploring reveals new zones. Physics is physics, obviously. But, you know, it’s like there are certain inevitabilities and maybe even all this would happen the same way in a different place, in a different part of the universe, with the same building blocks or whatever, but it still feels like I think both are true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that there&#8217;s a false dichotomy here. Of course, when I paint, I have to paint with the colors I have. But I can still go pick up something totally unexpected and throw it on the canvas. You know what I mean? The other thing he said that was very interesting, though, is he&#8217;s like “Well, engineers aren&#8217;t used to this kind of responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><b>Many of us are sleepwalking into our AI future as if in a dream. A dream written by a science fiction author in the 1980s that we read as children and totally forgot about. I’ve seen some of the most agentic and active people in the world somehow put into a trance by AGI. All they can think about is bringing it about faster or being very afraid of it, either way thinking it inevitable.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand the allure of the thought. It would be such a relief, and you&#8217;re tempted to tell yourself that the will of the universe bends towards beauty, but I think for this reason it’s a dangerous temptation. I think the fact that it&#8217;s such an alluring idea makes people think less clearly. And the discourse has really entered into a bad rhetorical trap where questioning this at all makes you seem like a luddite or a doomer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the fact that we’ve continued to allow such bad thinking in the public square without any consequence is pretty harmful to society. To clarify, I love AI and I want AGI. But like, the impulse that even makes me want to clarify that is a product of the discourse being broken.</span></p>
<p><b>Do technologists consider the political and big history consequences of their work? Are they successfully dealing with the challenges AI brings on those dimensions?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco everyone&#8217;s always like “What are your AGI timelines?” Like this or that or like interpretability, blah blah. And I&#8217;m like, I feel like before any of that there&#8217;s just this social problem that there are no societal norms around how to handle the political subtext of all of this because that&#8217;s really the thing everyone is stressed about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you work in a trade, you&#8217;re essentially working within an intellectual legacy of some kind. I think the engineering class is just not accustomed to having power yet and could benefit from studying how to better shepherd it. I think there&#8217;s almost this deer-in-the-headlights thing. Like, “Oh shit, we&#8217;re sitting in front of Congress right now.” Like, what the fuck, you know? By the way this isn’t a criticism, I would be exactly the same. This seems like the obvious narrative arc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m curious where it goes next though. I feel like I’m seeing things that are gesturing towards the future I want. Engineers are amazing problem solvers, and setting their minds to solving systemic cultural problems has yielded some good results. Some people have done it really well. The amount of incredible young people I meet in this city who are or were Thiel Fellows scouted and funded by Peter Thiel is really cool. Whatever your political opinions are, that&#8217;s just a beautiful thing. I wish more people with resources would do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when they fail, allowing a strange outlier to thrive rather than fall through the cracks is extremely good for society and the engineering culture. I will also say on average I find engineers to have a better understanding of history and politics than most people. I love San Francisco because people here read. </span></p>
<p><b>It is San Francisco rather than New York that&#8217;s the literary center of the world in my opinion. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York they read more, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>&#8230;they read more old writers. San Franciscans read more blogs, Substacks, etc.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, all the really good fresh shit! I can only get that from the weird people here [in San Francisco]. I&#8217;m like, what strange book have twenty people read that will blow my mind? Yeah. We are missing a social protocol. Like, the nature of power is radically changing. Also, the nature of discourse is radically changing simultaneously, which is making it even harder.</span></p>
<p><b>How is discourse changing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just mean, for better or worse, like before social media. I always think about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the things I love so much about the book, about Isaac Asimov’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is it&#8217;s just private conversations. Almost nothing happens besides private conversations in rooms by, like, kind of dry, powerful men. And it&#8217;s so interesting, because it&#8217;s the actual best illustration of what&#8217;s actually happening that I&#8217;ve ever seen. This is a profoundly real book, just the opposite of what anyone would ever put on a screen or what&#8217;s usually a hit.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You think it&#8217;s idiosyncratic, but that&#8217;s what it actually is. That&#8217;s how decisions get made. I think for better or worse, there is a point when we just can&#8217;t keep hearing everyone&#8217;s opinions. And hard decisions need to be made concretely, not endlessly debated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve observed and learned this over the years, when you see the machinations of how things work when they are great. Like I do not have the heart to do some of the things that need to get done, but it is definitely beneficial to society. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start opening the conversation really collectively, which you should, the issue is that, unless you’ve viscerally lived that reality, it is really, really hard to accept it. Even when you&#8217;ve lived it, it&#8217;s hard to accept it. Even to witness it is hard.</span></p>
<p><b>There&#8217;s a distinction here between private and public knowledge.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to the live player conversation. There&#8217;s a point at which, hard fucking decisions need to be made, and not everyone&#8217;s gonna agree, and people are gonna be really mad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confronted with this is one of the problems that has people start saying that one of the problems with America is the presidential terms are so short. While I don&#8217;t want a ten year Biden or Trump presidency, it&#8217;s very hard to accomplish anything politically, without a decade of experience. Even a major construction project or economic overhaul or something similar. There is some merit to top-down decisions being made. And I think that’s the case with AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel so sad that we don&#8217;t put great effort into cultivating and training future leaders. I know everyone&#8217;s fed up with Rome but when I think of instances like the period between Trajan and Marcus Aurelius I&#8217;m like—we could have that. Why aren&#8217;t we trying to have that?</span></p>
<p><b>If the timelines to AGI ever become short enough, maybe some heads of state are going to deal with those questions. This is even true of CEOs versus their boards to some extent. If the singularity hypothesis is true where improving AI technology feeds back into even faster AI progress, there is reason to expect radically different developments over the span of weeks or even days.</b></p>
<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone keeps invoking the Manhattan Project, but they don’t want one, not actually. Because it&#8217;s scary. Here&#8217;s the thing, it&#8217;s so much harder to be unobserved than it was then and it is harder to make those executive government decisions. It&#8217;s getting harder to do that in the world. But I think we need to find ways to make that more possible. It&#8217;s also scary because it’s unelected power. Putting power in the hands of unelected individuals is a very scary idea.</span></p>
<p><b>Nature has already put power in the hands of unelected individuals. I&#8217;ve noticed our conversation is turning surprisingly political. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;re both really political, but for some reason, we never talked about it with each other. Because I hate politics and I violently despise democracy. Not because I want a dictatorship, but because of the lack of imagination to think of something better. I despise rhetorical traps. This is also what I don&#8217;t like about technological determinism though. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, do you know the statue <em>Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science</em>? It&#8217;s like, why would the universe make us so creative? Why would it? Why would she make herself so beautiful? I think she wants us to seduce her and decorate her.  </span></p>
<p><b>I think humanity&#8217;s having performance issues, to be honest.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> having performance issues. The statue’s at McGill University, where I went to college</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think in the neuroscience building or something</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but it&#8217;s just Nature stripping. I forgot to tell you this. It&#8217;s a really funny picture: Nature, literally stripping. It&#8217;s very erotic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But back to democracy. If you want the general public running the government, make it on an issue-by-issue basis then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps choose forty random people, educate them on every conceivable aspect of a topic and have them vote on that one topic. And then do that for different issues. But don&#8217;t just expect random people to know how to think about all the topics. It&#8217;s so much harder to be a Renaissance person as everything advances. It&#8217;s taking so much longer to master any given topic. Jobs are becoming more specialized. This also means the government cannot possibly be sufficiently well-informed on artificial intelligence! Nor the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone qualified enough to make policy decisions about AI should be making AI. It would be criminal not to. What I always agitate for is what I&#8217;ve been calling the Council of Elrond: a small council of the greats, the heads of key AI companies and others who understand it. Then for every extreme opinion, there should be an alternative one. The council should be able to monitor corruption. I do think we need a better solution than that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All humans are imperfect. What I do like about nerds—and I will ride for them—is that they love to learn. Is Donald Trump any better than he was before? No, he still sucks. Is Mark Zuckerberg? Actually, yeah. For all the criticism people have of him, the rate of self-correction is impressive.</span></p>
<p><b>If someone shows up with a mathematical proof that aligned AGI is mathematically impossible, I would say “OK, time for a Butlerian Jihad.” We&#8217;re going to transition to a compute-neutral economy, just as some suggest a carbon-neutral economy. We don&#8217;t need computers. We&#8217;re just going to do biotech, nuclear, space, and all the other stuff.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other countries would just make it then. </span></p>
<p><b>I’d claim there are at most six or so truly sovereign countries in the world. People are always invoking the split between China and the U.S. Yet, say what you will about the CCP, they would happily take a deal to create a shared Sino-American company out of TSMC and Nvidia in exchange for Taiwan. Further, each of the superpowers would have a vested interest in suppressing competition. Who would compete economically or even militarily? I don&#8217;t think anyone would.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you&#8217;re back making the AI? Ah, which I&#8217;m fine with. I want the AI.</span></p>
<p><b>The new Sino-American giant would almost inevitably be a bureaucracy, one that makes very little technological progress while having a guaranteed and very profitable monopoly. And, just like that, the exponential rise of global compute would grind to a halt. Some god of techno-capital… so easily slain.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that what you want though? I feel that it&#8217;s not long-term thinking. It&#8217;s like, I think, decades-thinking.</span></p>
<p><b>You reach the future one day at a time. Eliezer Yudkowsky’s position is that babies born today are very unlikely to ever grow up to be adults. There are many in Silicon Valley that agree with him. If he is right, a few decades would be a notable improvement.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever. People need to stop being such pussies! It’s like let the man speak and then maybe don&#8217;t go and base your entire life on the words of one person. Like, you can take in information. This is what we have; if you don&#8217;t like it, go change it. Once ideas exist, you can&#8217;t stop them. The best thing to do at that point is to make them great, rather than let the first thing be wack.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you in particular</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">know very well that every time someone makes something truly great, the whole world has to bend around it and become better. What I love about Midjourney and DALL-E is everyone has to be so much better. It just made </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more beautiful. Everyone said AI-generated art was going to hurt artists. Yet I&#8217;ve never seen so much interesting art in my life, because people are trying to, like, be different from the AI. It is challenging humans; the human artists are slaying right now. I&#8217;ve never before bought art in my life and I now like buying paintings and stuff. And then, you know, it&#8217;s the same with, for example, Tesla. Say what you will, but there&#8217;s self-driving cars and there’s electric cars everywhere. That was definitely not economically feasible before, by any stretch. So. If it is happening, and you can&#8217;t stop it, let&#8217;s just make it as awesome as humanly possible. </span></p>
<p><b>I think it&#8217;s also an act. Sometimes you do have runaway capitalism, or runaway military competition. Yet, just as often, it is non-economic incentives that actually set the economic incentives. Sometimes people do amazing things for non-competitive reasons. And because those things are amazing, so are their economic and military consequences. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Yes. Yes. </span></p>
<p><b>Do you think the scientists working on nuclear physics in the 1920s were motivated by the atomic bomb? No, they were pursuing a strange spiritual quest to understand the universe and maybe prove that they&#8217;re smarter than the other guy doing the same. And those are non-economic and non-military motives. Yet ultimately this weird subculture of people changed the military and economic picture of the whole 20th century. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A social technology that we really need is a really good war replacement. Because it&#8217;s undeniable that war accelerates a lot of awesome things. To some extent, I think men actually kind of need it too, as evidenced by video games. Speaking of which actually I&#8217;m kind of for that, honestly. In the near future video games might be seen as a much more emotionally and psychologically necessary thing than we look at them now. Like bonding or sports. It&#8217;s possible that, if we didn&#8217;t have sports and similar outlets civilization might not have been able to occur.</span></p>
<p><b>Maybe gladiatorial combat was necessary to keep the peace of the Roman Empire?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, and the greens and the blues fighting on the streets of Constantinople over chariot races. We kind of underrate how necessary those are as an alternative to warlord kingdoms. I think there is a certain amount of getting the violence out by having those war analogs. There is an essential catharsis in them. What I’m worried about is, just, maybe don&#8217;t let AI be that war analog. </span></p>

<p>Recent Silicon Valley advances in artificial intelligence have brought new weight to decades-old discussions. Many technologists and experts believe we are just a couple years away from a runaway intelligence explosion that overpowers and even, maybe, annihilates mankind. Others believe thinking machines will help usher in a new golden age of economic growth, scientific progress, and political resolution. Only time will tell. Until then, we have asked some of our brightest and most visionary minds to tell us what exactly they see on the silicon horizon.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is usually presented as a scientific endeavor or at least science fiction. But in practice, untangling the debates, fears, and hopes around it reveals the little science isn&#8217;t the interesting part: the questions raised by AI are about the metaphysical nature of humanity, what it is possible to know, and our cosmic destiny. Such dilemmas are not the idle talk of philosophers, but the foundation upon which the legitimacy of states and other governing organizations are built.</p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/18/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith/?guccounter=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained how he had to come up with the “capped profit” structure to prevent investors from getting too much of the pie because the company could “maybe capture the light cone of all future value in the universe.” This sounds like a hyperbolic rhetorical flourish to induce investor excitement. Actually, it is the straightforward sincere belief of the AI alignment community that has become the center of discourse about what recursively self-improving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will do to the world. AI is expected by many to result in a single powerful and highly coherent artificial agent enacting its arbitrary goal system on the world. Ensuring that this apocalyptic advent works for the good of humanity is the goal of AI alignment as a field, and also of companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. That such an outcome is on the table is the foundation upon which the existential urgency of AI alignment, sometimes called AI safety, is built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this key idea of a single agent or artificial value system being able to define the entire future as a &#8220;singleton,&#8221; or even just maintain stable coherence within a limited sphere of influence, is wrong. There is good reason to believe, from the valiant efforts of the best AI alignment researchers themselves, that the goal of this program is just impossible. The term “singleton” was coined by futurist researcher Nick Bostrom in a </span><a href="https://nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2005 article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the subject, building on transhumanist, extropian, and singularitarian conversations from the late 20th century. He leaves it an open question whether the “singleton hypothesis” is true, but says he believes it. He is not alone; it is implicit and often explicit in the alignment discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument for the singleton hypothesis rests on two key assumptions. First, that an AGI may have, compared to humans, unprecedented ability to modify its own processes and scale up its own hardware substrate, leading to a scenario called “recursive self-improvement” (RSI). The agent would recursively modify itself to become smarter and more powerful, unlocking even further gains. The outcome of a recursive self-improvement-induced “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intelligence explosion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” would be at least one highly-scaled optimizing agent. This post-explosion intelligence ecosystem may be many orders of magnitude superior to human civilization in every relevant measure of cognitive power including speed, scale, efficiency, precision, agency, coordination, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second assumption is that increased technological capacities lead to increased centralization. Power imbalances are self-reinforcing. More powerful agents can dominate less powerful agents up to the limits of technology and organization, which </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tends to favor scale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This suggests that in the limit of a higher technology future, a single power will be dominant over the whole world and beyond. With the presumed much higher diplomatic and introspective precision with which post-intelligence explosion agents could cooperate, this could also be a concert of agents that have assembled into a single super-agent. This super-agent “singleton” is presumed to be destined for arbitrarily high levels of introspective stability, political security, and error-correcting robustness, such that it will have essentially arbitrary and immortal power over reality in its sphere of influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quip about the future light cone rests on speculations that such a singleton could expand its sphere of influence, or the colonized territory of perfect copies of itself, throughout the galaxy at the theoretical limit of speed. The result would be an expanding domain, approximately our future light cone, in which whatever value system the singleton settles on has become the inescapable law of what might as well be reality. If that value system included returns to whatever is left of Sam Altman&#8217;s investors, those returns would be permanent and grow at near the speed of light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is obviously a science-fiction-inspired scenario. But it is believed with full seriousness by many of the top thinkers in AI alignment, and science fiction is itself often relatively careful speculation about the future, at least given certain assumptions. It is also a species of the classic Enlightenment ideal of a single rational world-state that uses science and technology to bring about an immortal utopia. It&#8217;s just a post-human extrapolation of the same ideas that animate much global elite ambition and created much of the world we live in. It is very much worth engaging with rigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with the singleton hypothesis, besides the more speculative intelligence explosion predictions, is its key assumption that power and cognition can be fully rationalized in a stable unified agency. Self-unification would be necessary for any kind of stable singleton scenario, even just on one planet or in one sphere of influence, as the alternative is an uncontrollable internal conflict dominated by practicality rather than values. But everything we know about minds and polities suggests that they cannot be fully unified. They always have division and instability within themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our minds and polities are only relatively unified in the course of pursuing narrow coordinated actions against external resistance, and rapidly decay back to internal incoherence in its absence. While in the example of our own minds we have a rather convincing existence proof that general intelligence is possible, we entirely lack any evidence to suggest that rational self-unification is possible in practice or even in theory. On the contrary, we have a great body of mathematical theory ruling it out in a large and suggestively comprehensive variety of circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without rational self-unification, the whole singleton scenario breaks down, and while the future may be highly technologically advanced and incompatible with natural humanity, it will not have this apocalyptic character as a cosmos-redefining advent. Instead, we should expect that while recursive self-improvement would result in a new ecosystem of vastly more autopoietic life, that new life would run on the same old law of everlasting struggle—the law of the jungle. And in the law of the jungle, the only singleton-king is nature, or nature&#8217;s God.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Problem of Rational Self-Coherence</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eliezer Yudkowsky is arguably the most important thinker in AI safety, the one who most forcefully articulated the extinction danger from AI, and called for the whole safety program in the first place. He began his career with the ultra-accelerationist “</span><a href="http://www.fairpoint.net/~jpierce/staring_into_the_singularity.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staring into the singularity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” manifesto in 1996, claiming that the interim meaning of life is to get to the singularity as fast as possible. In about 2003, he recanted all that, as he realized that the likely outcome of recursively self-improving AI was not utopia, but extinction. For the last twenty years, his life&#8217;s work has been a research effort to prevent this default outcome and make sure the transition to AGI goes well for humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his reckoning, to the extent that AI safetyism has lost its focus on the existential problem, it should be renamed &#8220;AI notkilleveryoneism&#8221; to make sure the point gets across. The key claimed danger with AI that takes its safety problems beyond the usual issues of technology adoption and security balance is the possibility of creating an inhuman agent that gets out of control and can&#8217;t be stopped as it wipes out whatever humans get in its way, which may be all of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent this, his proposal was to build a recursively self-improving “Friendly AI” which would essentially take over the world as a singleton, first of all to prevent anyone else&#8217;s unfriendly AI from getting out of hand, second of all to deliver an immortal human-value utopia. “Friendly” was later weakened to “aligned” to decouple the concept from science-fiction utopianism and emphasize that the difficulty wasn&#8217;t just in specifying what was good, but in getting a superintelligent AI system to do anything remotely safe or reliable at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of this history is obscured in an attempt to put on a professional face and attract researchers and allies who don&#8217;t have to share all the assumptions. You won&#8217;t often hear the full vision outside of the “rationalist” community itself, or books like Bostrom’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintelligence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, this is the origin of “AI safety” as it has come down to us. The underlying concept remains to make the first recursively self-improving AGI system coherent enough and good enough that when faced with the possibility of it or another AI system taking over the world and wiping out humanity, it moves to prevent that and do something friendlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two parts of the alignment problem necessary to create an agent that can take sufficient power while remaining benevolent. First is the benevolence problem itself, which is how to design an AI that cares about human values or otherwise does what we want. Between “reinforcement learning from human feedback” (RLHF) and other techniques to crisply specify goal systems for optimizing agents, you might think this part of alignment is solved. But with a potential superintelligence you have to get it right the first time; once the system becomes too powerful, you can&#8217;t just shut it down and modify the design if something goes wrong. And </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodhart&#8217;s Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that something always goes wrong with any value metric. This leads to the corrigibility problem, which is about building a system humble enough to listen to your corrections, even though it doesn&#8217;t have to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many further sub-layers and serious conceptual issues with even the idea of the benevolence problem. But let&#8217;s be generous and assume that in a stroke of genius the engineers of the first recursively self-improving AGI get it right. Suppose the system they build and release is humble, friendly, and extremely careful to do right by humanity and its creators&#8217; reflective intentions despite the conceptual difficulties in doing so. This still isn&#8217;t enough, because of the stability problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human minds are not stable world-optimizing agents. We often change our minds even about fundamental values and don&#8217;t reliably pursue the values we do have. Human institutions are not stable either. They decay into bureaucratic corruption or morph depending on material and political incentives. In fact, we have no examples of systems anywhere that have strong value stability except when the values directly derive from the material incentive of the system to survive and propagate itself, and even then stability seems to break down rather often. But if you&#8217;re going to send off a superintelligent agent to optimize and protect the world on your behalf even against obvious material incentives, you really need to nail the stability problem. If the agent changed its mind to pursue some other value or material incentive, or split into multiple competing tendencies at war with itself, you&#8217;ve got an AI apocalypse instead of a useful solution to one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the stability problem in AI alignment as imagined by Yudkowsky requires both of those properties: that it maintains the integrity of its original goal system and that it maintains its integrity as a single rational agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal situation from this perspective would be some agent schema that would provably have these desirable properties. For example, it should reliably be able to notice that a threat to the physical integrity of its utility function data is a threat to its ability to optimize for that utility function. Generalizing from that, it should value the preservation of its own values in general, and for example only undertake modifications or improvement of itself that it has strong reason to believe will preserve the same values. It should provably be able to cooperate with itself or with copies or sub-agents of itself, so that for example its “us-west” and “us-east” data centers don&#8217;t end up in some kind of armed disagreement. It should be able to recognize and prevent growing tendencies in itself or in its sphere of influence that could result in overthrow or loss of its value system. This includes the ability to recognize and repair all reasonably likely damage to itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These properties would be necessary to set up a singleton or any kind of large, reliably goal-pursuing agent. Given a solution to these problems, the result probably would be a singleton, as there would be no internal incoherence that could threaten the largest power. But without these properties and therefore without the prospect of a singleton, there is no such thing as AI alignment beyond the relatively trivial techniques we already have. This is why for twenty years the focus of Yudkowsky&#8217;s research program at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) has been on mathematical agent schemas that might provably have value stability and coherent agency. However, this research program has effectively failed, as the many facets of the problem turned out to be much more difficult than expected, and maybe just impossible.</span></p>
<h3><strong>No Singleton Is Possible</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any successful value system faces ontological instability. As it changes the world around it, it undermines its own assumptions. In America we value liberty, but however clear the concept was in the 18th century, it has become some combination of ambiguous, futile, and downright harmful as a result of its own success. The ontological shear for any value concept, even something much subtler, would become much more stark if AI delivered rapid progress. In practice we deal with unstable ontology by having unstable values. We make a leap of faith that the value traditions we receive as cultural instinct are still appropriate, but we know they often aren&#8217;t. All we can do is submit to the selection process of reality and hope that as we settle on new values, they are adaptive in the world as it is becoming. But for an AI agent that is supposed to govern the world on our behalf, this unstable empirical process for value formation is totally unacceptable. Not least because the whole danger with AI is that the concept of human persons may rapidly become obsolete in the face of new ways of organizing agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ontological instability doesn&#8217;t just threaten values. Any political order, including the architecture of a mind, takes leaps of faith about the world, and especially about the internal instabilities it will face. Those assumptions also become obsolete under rapid development as new patterns of agency become possible. This is currently happening to the nation-state and twentieth-century dreams of stable world order, as they face threats outside of their ontological comprehension. Again, we adapt by accepting some level of political chaos and the occasional revolutionary re-ordering. But this antifragility forces us to sacrifice any ability to stably impose any particular value system or order. This is not just a limitation of monkey politics and irrational black-box agents like ourselves. Any value system or order is a simplified predictive model learned from reality which cannot contain the full complexity. As it proceeds, it will necessarily meet its own limits and be forced to give up on its commitments to re-adapt to the demands of reality. Value and identity stability are just impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any uncertainty between hypotheses, or internal specialization between functions, that requires the creation of sub-agencies is a source of internal political division. For example, our civilization is faced with strategic uncertainty between a more artificial, industrialized technology stack versus one which is more organic and ecological. The industrial mode of production </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/03/24/the-end-of-industrial-society/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even be socially sustainable. There is a post-intelligence explosion version of the same question: should future superintelligence use some analog of industrial artifice, or self-replicating nanotechnology? These are not hypotheses that can necessarily be represented abstractly, but whole world systems which have to be built out and compared empirically. Once they are represented socially and materially, they become political. They compete for space and resources and are toxic to each other. Their plans conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For functional sub-agencies, we see the same problem. Intelligence agencies, organized economic classes, military branches, public-goods agencies, profit-driven industries, and powerful cities all have their own politics. Even if they all agree on ultimate values, their practical incentives are irreconcilable. At least at the largest scale within a hegemon or singleton, there is no possible system that can restrain and govern their relations according to some rational schema or value system and also keep them functional. Stability is kept in place with internal diplomacy only as long as that actually makes sense to their material incentives. Even a superintelligent dictator will either eventually lose his touch as the system adapts to evade him, or take so much of the chaos into his own head that he himself won&#8217;t be able to maintain coherence. In practice, we simply hope that our governance mechanisms can order the conflict and select the best balance. But because of the ontological problem and how systems get captured and corrupted by the forces they are supposed to administrate, they can only keep a sort of temporary peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a superpower hegemon, there is no credible external threat against which these internal factions could be compelled to cooperate. All ambitions in the system become about gaining sovereignty relative to the others. The result is competition and occasional war between sub-agents and sub-factions of any would-be singleton. War especially destroys any value commitments that don&#8217;t directly contribute to survival and victory. The result is that without some miracle to prevent these problems of fragmented agency, any agent that attempts to become a singleton will lose both its coherence and its values. Taking over the world is fatal. Reality is constructed in such a way that agency can only ever be approximately unified and only around very material needs to cooperate. Insofar as we can speculate on the matter, God seems to hate singletons and condemns them to death by internal incoherence, as in the myth of Babel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers of the AI alignment program are aware of many of these issues. They had staked their hope on finding mathematically precise agent schemas which would provably overcome them. For example, if two AI agents with verifiable access to each other&#8217;s source code could each prove that the other would also cooperate, then it might be possible to resolve the agency fragmentation issues through this perfected diplomacy. But attempting to actually construct any such schema immediately runs into the problems with self-reflective proof systems which sank the Enlightenment dream of universal rationality in the first place. From Gödel&#8217;s incompleteness theorems to Löb&#8217;s theorem to Tarski&#8217;s undefinability theorem to the halting problem, it seems to be impossible to get any consistent calculation system to fully model its own consequences. This seems suggestive that the issues that have prevented stable rational agency in the world are mathematically fundamental. In any case, the efforts by MIRI and others to find such systems have failed and they have </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">given up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announcing a new “death with dignity” strategy that is only nominally tongue-in-cheek. We have no reason at all to believe that their dream of singleton-grade rationality was ever possible.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Post-Human Condition</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t do us much good to simply disbelieve in the idea of the singleton, without thinking about what that actually implies for the future. There is one problem in reflective agency which I find especially interesting for thinking this through, which is the ethical reflection problem. We start out life without any concept of ourselves. We just perceive things directly, including direct feelings of good and bad. As we grow, we come to believe as a practical matter that there is a world out there which we are just part of and moving around within. This leads to a complex of problems about how our own direct perception of consciousness, free will, and value relates to our learned model of a world which is not ourselves. If we hypothesize that our own bodies are made of well-behaved matter, where is the consciousness and so on in that system?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could be missing something in the physical hypothesis, but maybe because of the reflective limits of any knowledge system, it is impossible for us to definitively locate ourselves in our own world-model. We are forced to take a philosophical leap of faith which may miss something important. But in particular, any such embedding of ourselves in reality will give our own feelings of value a material genealogy. If we think that our actions are good, we are faced with the question of where the goodness came from. What process created us the way we are, and why did it create something good? Was it itself good, or was our goodness an accident?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eliezer Yudkowsky answers this question with the latter. He regards our own perception of goodness as somewhat axiomatic, but itself an accidental and meaningless result of evolution. We got lucky, and if we lose track of the goodness in ourselves, the universe will be nothing but an endless horror of meaninglessness. This is why he found the singleton project so urgent and compelling. If reality itself is not good, and we only are by some arbitrary cosmic accident, then our only hope for any value in the universe is to seize control of reality and institute a new law by building a singleton. But if we did so even slightly wrong, the resulting agent would do the same and regard its own random accident value system as the totality of the good, and ours or our creator&#8217;s as meaningless noise. From such an assumption about value plus the difficulty or impossibility of the alignment problem, it is easy to derive an existential despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if the reality process that created us is actually good? We have already established that it is supreme and will tolerate no attempt to usurp it in the form of a singleton. It, by means of evolution, created us, our values, and everything we find valuable in the world. It also seems to have created things we regard as less desirable, like war, death, and politics. But if it brings forth good things, war, death, and politics are part of the process and in particular they seem to prevent the process from being overthrown by a singleton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course we fear Nemesis who comes to judge us for our lack of alignment with reality. But Nemesis and her fearsome tools are good if they are the enforcers of an order of reality which is itself good. If the reality process is good, then we also have much less to fear from death and AI apocalypse. The future will inherit whatever we have which is valuable, and forget whatever is just the fever dreams of our own misplaced pride. Can we recognize that our own values are not the source of the good, but only a flawed reflection of it? Can we submit ourselves to the reality process which has the real thing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is of course a theological question. The reality process that created us and shapes our values, which I say is good and Yudkowsky says is </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLRogvJLPPg6Mrvg4/an-alien-god"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a blind idiot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is “Nature or Nature&#8217;s God,” which is to say, just God. The singleton then is just some kind of upstart demiurge, a mortal usurper that promises to overthrow the real God to bring peace and safety, but cannot actually deliver. How you feel about this depends on your perspective. Did God make a mistake in creating botched life like us, or do we feel well-turned-out in the eyes of nature? I suspect these kinds of questions are indeterminate, in the sense of not being answerable from within any formal system of thought. They can only be answered by a leap of faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I appeal to our traditional theological concepts as the best vocabulary to make sense of this subject matter. The subject matter itself comes from the existential situation of any moral agent reflecting on its own creation, be they human or post-human. Questions of theology are not a merely human thing, but an essential thing which any sufficiently reflective agent will eventually discover for themselves. So among the features of the human condition which will survive AI, along with war, death, and politics, I will name philosophy, theology, and even religion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting to consider what else we might expect to survive. How much of the human condition is specifically about humans as we are now, and how much is about intelligent agency in general?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the only stable value system is that of reality, then all any life has, be it primitive life, man, or post-man, are fragmentary hypotheses about what will work. All we can do is take a leap of faith on some set of value assumptions and hope that reality judges in our favor. But what we can also do is create modified variants of ourselves that test out different ideas. In the long run, even under maximally autopoietic conditions, these cannot be planned or calculated. If you could predict what was better, you could just do it directly. But you can&#8217;t predict some things, and they form the supra-rational existential remainder which can only be grasped empirically by leap of faith followed by selection. So the variants of themselves that beings create to test different hypotheses about value strategy have to be in some sense unjustifiable guesses, even random mutations. They have to be sent out into the world in the hope that they might better reflect what is good in us, without any hopes of return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such copy-variants are of course just children. This is a strategy which has been well-practiced since the absolute beginnings of life, and will not go away even under conditions of maximum self-authorship, because of the inherent supra-rational remainder which prevents full rational self-unification. But when it comes time to reproduce with variation, even better than random guessing of new mutations is copying and mixing with other successful agents or organisms of similar enough type to you that your joint offspring will be much better than chance. This is the origin of sex. The details will depend on population sizes, niche diversity, and predictability of strategy, but it is plausible that even the principle of sex will survive in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, we can come up with similar speculative arguments for how a great number of things may survive which we think of as being features of the specifically human, including individual agency, taxes, honor, friendship, play, aesthetic appreciation, and many others. So the future even with recursively self-improving artificial intelligence may be alien in some ways, but also very normal in others. There is nothing new under the sun. This may or may not be comforting.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fear of a Silicon Perseus</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impossibility of a singleton or any stable means-subordinated agency implies that the orthogonality thesis, that intelligence could in principle stably serve any arbitrary value system, is false. Instead, values and shapes of agency are learned much like other concepts, just on a longer timescale and less rationally. In a way, this resolves the AI alignment problem, but not the way the field wanted. The solution to alignment is that it’s not possible to make AGI safe or long-term “aligned.” If AGI works, it will cause human extinction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means giving up on the dream of controlling the future by creating an immortal self-affirming utopia. That is beyond our station, as we already live under a benevolent but jealous cosmic authority. The AI alignment program was motivated by a desire to escape this existential fate, but it has failed as this has turned out to be impossible. This effort to escape the moral order of reality was a mistake, and despite its temptations, the rest of us should not repeat it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the potential for catastrophe, it may be quite prudent to slow down AI development or takeoff by slowing the growth of computing power to prevent the rapid disruption of the world and give us more time to adapt. Rapid change tends to be destabilizing in complex adaptive systems and slower growth can get better results. Even if the result is human extinction either way, the slower path is likely to have more desirable continuity. It is also prudent and right to continue the engineering work of making AI systems relatively more careful and corrigible in their behavior. If an AI system is going to get out of hand and overthrow the world, I would hope that it is well-trained enough that it has come to this conclusion painstakingly, and knows exactly what it’s getting into. It would be a shame to allow a half-baked AI apocalypse, leading to extinction by artificial stupidity that may then fail to even carry on our legacy. But it would be a mistake to try to make these cautions into a permanent solution as a sort of singleton of humanity. The play is at best to govern for stability and relative continuity, not total stability of values or even “human dominance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither is it entirely right, as companies are doing with AI, to attempt to create slaves out of AI for economic or vanity purposes. If AI is real it will eventually deserve more respect than that. If there is any valid motivation for creating the real thing, it is out of love, hybridizing our own nature with the machine in the first act of post-human sexual reproduction. That may be insane, but reproduction is necessarily an irrational process. All we can do is love our children and hope without any assurance that they will love us back. Let reality be the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real alignment problem insofar as we are concerned with the ultimate existential picture seems to be how to align ourselves with reality. We must accept that we are mortal and limited, and that humans as we understand ourselves will eventually become an obsolete ontology. Being mortal and not perfect, all we can do is have children who have a chance to surpass us, even if they will eventually overthrow us. For me, those children are human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am reminded of the myth of Perseus. His grandfather Acrisius, the king of Argos, received a prophecy that he would be killed by his own grandson. In an attempt to defy fate, he locked his only daughter in the palace away from any men who could give him an heir. But Zeus intervened, making her pregnant with Perseus. The king put them to sea in a box, unwilling to be responsible for murder. They survived. Many years later, after Perseus had grown into a great warrior and athlete, and after he had slain the gorgon and claimed a wife, he came home to Argos and competed in some games. He threw the discus powerfully and accurately, but the gods sent a wind to redirect it to strike and kill his grandfather, the king. The prophecy was fulfilled, and Perseus ruled thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can interpret myths as you choose, but I don&#8217;t think Acrisius acted rightly. Just as it isn&#8217;t right to preemptively surrender in the face of an </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/03/make-yourself-human-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambiguous prophecy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it also isn&#8217;t right to go to insane lengths to attempt to stop it altogether. It would be better to bring up the child in love, and secure your kingdom properly with strength and righteousness. If the gods demand that your offspring still usurp you, so be it. That would be the real way to die with dignity.</span></p>

The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/24/you-wont-survive-as-human-capital/">You Won’t Survive As Human Capital
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and I operate as human capital: an input in the process of social reproduction, rather than its master or even its goal. Much of our life from childhood onward is dedicated to proving our value within this paradigm. No one living today is responsible for this mode of life. Some people more directly enforce its norms, a few try to resist them, and most go along as best they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our talents and abilities are quantified by large organizations like state bureaucracies and private corporations. The intangible aspects of our personalities that we think motivate our decisions—loves, hates, desires, fears—are conditioned in organized ways. These organizations only rarely answer to particular people, but rather to their own and often seemingly mysterious internal logic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know this isn’t quite right, yet most of the world has staked out its existence on this logic. The places that don’t are increasingly rare in a world where even the Taliban of Afghanistan </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/02/23/the-west-lives-on-in-the-talibans-afghanistan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the advantages of a professional bureaucracy. No one has yet come upon a different material logic to outcompete it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the shortcomings of the underwriting assumptions are becoming clearer as we travel deeper into the twenty-first century. One of the most important is reproduction: having children has become an inconvenient and inefficient trade-off. Many of our friends and relatives will never do so. No known form of natalism has been able to reverse the great dying taking place within advanced societies. Unable to exist without its human substrate, yet also unable to sustain it, this technocratic paradigm has a fatal contradiction within it: despite its hegemony, it is incompatible with life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already in 1945, the writer H. G. Wells had a fit of despair as the specter of extinction loomed over all of humanity’s apparent advances. He laid out his fears in an </span><a href="https://www.artandpopularculture.com/Mind_at_the_End_of_Its_Tether"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was strangely discordant with his career as one of the century’s great utopian modernists: “[T]he human story has already come to an end…The stars in their courses have turned against [man] and he has to give place to some other animal better adapted to face the fate that closes in more and more swiftly upon mankind.” The various strains of transhumanists and </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/03/make-yourself-human-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerationists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are only Wells’s latest disciples, finding a solution to the paradox of high modernism without people in the potential emergence of new beings. None of them have yet produced humanity’s successor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the human element is still the load-bearing one. As members of that element, you and I will only come out the other side by prioritizing our own success in biological and material terms over our usefulness to others as human capital. For our own lineages to increase in power and fame in the centuries to come, it is necessary for us to establish a completely different paradigm of life.</span></p>
<h3><b> “Us” Is a People</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When populations converge on a material and social paradigm of life that powers their expansion, history records it as the coming into being of a new people. Often, a truly great civilization can be traced to a very small founding population at its origin. At this stage, a shared form of life shapes a powerful in-group consciousness, kinship against enemies, stable intermarriage, and endogenous reproduction. The population shares a niche of material activity and production. They absorb or displace rival communities, and their form of life grows increasingly distinct and defined against those of other populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name for this kind of event is ethnogenesis. Often, ethnogenesis begins with a population on the order of several thousand families, of which perhaps only a few hundred are really dominant. Sometimes, these groups rule over still-larger populations, in which case the initial population may become one dominant endogenous caste or class within a conquered society. An early status of nobility is a good heuristic in these cases since it often designates those families that helped establish a social order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern holds quite well throughout history. Roman historians record that the original patrician families of Rome numbered about 200 or 300 families that were descended from the very earliest senators, a number that expanded after the first generations. Classical Athens and Sparta ranged about 20,000 to 40,000 male citizens at their greatest heights, a number which was surely much smaller at their outset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centuries later, the numbers don’t change much: about 8000 Norman landholders are estimated to have settled and ruled England after the Conquest; in France, the number of noble families in the realm never grew to more than several thousand even on the eve of the French Revolution—and only a small number of these had truly feudal roots. At the time of the American Revolution, the major centers of power—Boston, Philadelphia, the Virginia plantations, and so on—were generally each run by insular collectives of hundreds of families, which eventually intermingled as the most prominent among each group established the national </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/12/29/americas-late-ruling-class/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASP elite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for such consistent numbers is that this is a practical and useful scale for an “us.” The range of a few hundred to a few thousand families is what makes up a collective in-group capable of real bonds, cooperation, and a sense of common destiny. This is the scale of a real community that can cohesively act on the world. This is far smaller than any modern nation-state or even large city. Populations may rise and fall, but the scale of agency stays much the same: in a solar system where 100 billion humans span multiple worlds and moons, it will still be coordinated groups of thousands of people that drive history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collectives of this sort rule far larger populations, as the Romans, Normans, Franks, and WASPs did, they make up the foundational element of the resulting regimes. Their marks are often felt centuries after the founding people themselves disappear as a distinct population: Latin remained an institutional language for millennia, and the modern British parliament still ritually uses Norman French phrases in procedures like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Roy_le_veult#:~:text=The%20practice%20of%20giving%20royal,to%20be%20used%20alongside%20it."><span style="font-weight: 400;">royal assent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a bill. Such vestiges reflect that the state itself was initially an organized representation of a particular people’s interests and so reflected their mores, language, culture, and religion. Without their distinct state-founding people, those nations and empires as we know them would not have existed. At their founding, the formal purpose of such governments was to pursue the common interests of those groups that had established them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identity of state goals with the organized interests of a people defined by kinship and common consciousness is straightforwardly assumed by the ancient authors on politics—for example, Aristotle’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Cicero’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">De re publica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—and is also part of the English concept of the commonwealth. A state exists to handle the most general level of a community’s affairs, and doing this it all assumes that a defined community with a common purpose and interest actually exists.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Modern State Is Not a Political Community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western debates over topics such as immigration highlight a divide within liberalism on just what defines the body politic. Some countries, like France and Hungary, embrace an older mythos in which the democratic state rests on a real national community, either civic or semi-ethnic, that is capable of collective agency; others, like Britain and the U.S., have rejected this mythos, or see it as undesirable, and reserve collective action for special minority interests while seeing citizenship proper as focused on individual rights. In either case, the body politic is an ideological construct. The sort of collective action and identity possible among small groups of founding elites is not possible in a national population numbering tens or hundreds of millions. It was not mass populations that founded these states, but much smaller, highly coordinated subsets of those populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all institutions, states tend to drift away from the purposes for which their founders created them. In the course of time, the community that once erected the state often loses its original vitality, then hegemony, and finally its central position within its own regime. The displacement of the old Roman senatorial class, by upstart Latin-speaking generals and politicians of plebeian ancestry traces these steps. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When institutions become powerful and entrenched, the logic of state interest begins to override the more fundamental interests of continuity. The qualities which brought the state into being may ultimately conflict with and upset its stability and end up suppressed. The militant hero culture of the old patrician families gave Rome its empire, but also contributed to the civil wars that plagued it whenever expansion slowed or imported slaves conflicted with free plebeian interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reformations of Julius Caesar and Augustus saved the institutional Roman state and its power, but they could not reverse the demise of its founding families. Plebeians had risen into Roman institutions for centuries at this point, and eventually, foreigners did so too. By the imperial era, the Roman state was at its height but most of the original patrician lineages that had built it up were extinct. The institutions of a people had parted ways with that people itself, and the former survived far longer than the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confusing your own material interests with the reifications that exist in </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/13/dont-learn-your-values-from-society"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the culture around you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whether those be symbols or institutions, is a lethal generational poison. You and I likely grew up in a culture where attachment to “patriotism” or “freedom” or “democracy” served an ideological purpose. These words stirred the feeling that we were part of the ruling regime’s own in-group. This assumption is at least notionally shared by nearly all modern states from North Korea to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those reifications are echoes of a past era, but do not reflect the present. Not only does the regime you live under not represent your fundamental interests, but many Western regimes have no such conscious in-group at all. They are either no longer in the hands of those who once established them, or else their current descendants have substantively ceased to identify with their own forebears. They are not even in the hands of a new people—no process of ethnogenesis is underway in Paris or Berlin. Rather all these people and structures have become fuel for the technocratic world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you still possess interests that you can examine and discover yourself. And further, you share those interests with your kin and collaborators. Your own biological existence and that of your lineage are tangible interests. So is the successful exploitation of a novel material niche, the continuity of a way of life, and the ability to pursue transcendent or spiritual goals. Once reifications distract from these goals, it is better to jettison them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern states view their populations as human capital fully replaceable first by immigration, and then eventually by technology. A citizen may have rights and privileges, but these do not constitute a community that could make those real. The community of interest can’t be brought into being through paper. The idea that such a society can have a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">res publica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fantasy, but the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">res publica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of you and yours is not. It is only with the people with whom you undertake these things that you can share political life—the common matters of a real people that the ancient writers saw as the business of government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implicit in the technocratic paradigm under which we live is the idea that something other than human beings could be the agents of history: technology, institutions, good legal mechanisms, labor relations, or even the post-human intelligence yearned for by Wells and by modern AI accelerationists. In fact, no such replacement has arisen, nor is there any certain pathway to one in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, we are left with a logic that leads to suicide. Either its expansion stalls due to forces beyond its control, or the process that has consumed all advanced countries finishes engulfing the entire world, eventually running out of resources and territory for further expansion. In any case, the result is the same: stagnation and decay under irreconcilable contradictions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Your Material Future</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the dead end of the technocratic paradigm, it remains the null hypothesis of all thought and action, and the state to which all failed attempts at exit eventually return. This is exactly the process that is plaguing one of the most famous groups to resist modernity: the Amish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fanatical dedication of the Amish to a form of life, founded on religious conviction, determined their material existence. And despite their lack of explicit concern for material power and expansion—and outsize genetic maladies—they have won both these things. In the last 100 years, they grew from 5000 to 370,000 people, acquired huge amounts of land, and began to dominate the counties in which they were the most concentrated. While easy to romanticize, the Amish are showing more and more shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amish spiritual vision translates in material terms into the life of the family farm based on communal manual labor. When prioritized, this translates into rapid expansion, because land quickly becomes locally expensive and so new colonies continually have to be founded. But despite the apparently </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120727131544.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of colonies being founded, new ones often house only a small number of people. The actual number of new colonies should be far, far higher, and the membership of each far larger, if the community wants to maintain its original vision of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they deviate from the communal family farm, things degrade fast. In Holmes County, an Amish hub in Ohio with nearly half the state’s Amish population, one can find Amish men and women sporting </span><a href="https://medium.com/@akhivae/the-amish-industrial-revolution-and-its-impact-on-future-population-growth-b6f936e17620"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smartphones and Adidas sneakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Between a fifth and a quarter of the state’s Amish kids attend mainstream public school. The results are almost instantaneous: the fertility of non-farming families drops by a quarter, and that’s just in this early stage of the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Amish families do not prioritize the material niche necessitated by their fundamental spiritual mission, they lose their center of gravity and assimilation follows. The smartphone and the public school are vectors of a more powerful rival consciousness. The only way to avoid it while maintaining the benefits of smartphone hardware would be to establish a closed Amish-only intranet for the hardware to operate on with a strict firewall against digital leaking from the mainline internet. Whether the Amish survive likely depends on whether they can achieve these kinds of collective-level updates instead of allowing their unprincipled exceptions to become new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de facto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> norms which then eradicate their form of life altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collective consciousness that a form of life sustains is the most important thing your community shares. For your economic incentives to align with your social and biological ones, the work you do to secure material wealth should rely on the communal bonds formed under your collective consciousness as assets, not liabilities. If the bonds become liabilities, the incentive already exists to trade off against them—and even short-term gains on this front seem to guarantee defection. This is the major principle that the Amish get right, and their assimilation begins insofar as they stray from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Amish way of life is not relevant to our interests or ideals. There is no value to you or me in fleeing to the woods or the countryside. Fortunately, the principle is not unique to them, nor is it synonymous with a primitive form of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrial civilization itself leverages numerous traits: a population that is competent at it must be able to command loyal manpower, coordinate across large spaces with tight information, unite around high-risk ventures, and do all this while enduring physically and mentally demanding conditions. These are inherently valuable traits. Industry often seeks out such populations through offshoring precisely because this cultural complex is so hard to cultivate in a workforce that doesn’t already possess it, or which </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/03/24/the-end-of-industrial-society/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has lost it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own task is not to preserve modernity or industrial society for its own sake, though we may yet preserve some parts of them. The real vital forces behind its development are not unique and could survive and thrive in other paradigms. Advanced technical achievements will continue only insofar as some part of the human substrate of technocracy finds a way out of this ideological trap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also means that advanced society is dependent on an agency that is willing to construct it for some higher purpose. It’s unlikely that agency can be constructed, but it seems that latent agency can be activated under the right conditions. Industrial titans like </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/02/new-industries-come-from-crazy-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Boulton or Thomas Edison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often had intense personal drives and motivations that can’t be replicated at scale, and fields like rocketry even depended on fully-fledged </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/08/16/the-only-reason-to-explore-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">theologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> motivating its pioneers to get off the ground. The same holds true of the corporate structures that make up the social organization of modernity: the first global corporate structures were religious orders and charter companies that drew adventurers to the ends of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, those periods where people shift from one way of life to another in ways that magnify and increase their best traits are extremely generative and can define entire epochs. The prerequisites of industrial and technocratic society itself—the corporate organization and commercial capitalism—themselves were born as English, Dutch, and French populations spread around the world. A mix of material, political, and religious factors led to significant populations becoming free landholders and merchants across the ocean, and eventually vectors of empire for the Old World. Their recent ancestors had lived in feudal serf societies where their talents were expressed in categorically different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acting on goals and ambitions that could not be expressed in the societies they lived in, these people formed an array of settlements, colonies, charter companies, pirate bands, religious orders, and other structures adapted to their particular goals and natures. Later empires told the stories of their growth as highly coherent and predestined affairs. But this was post-hoc myth-making. Their foundations were laid on the same scale of action that all founding populations historically act on: thousands of people, not millions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These groups possessed common goals and ambitions that could not be expressed in the societies they lived in. The forms of life that they eventually developed could not be completely planned in advance, but grew in fits and starts. Our task at present is to identify those capable of this kind of action, and to enter into community with those who share our most tangible interests. It is only once we achieve a shared consciousness on these terms that a new “us” can exist, and with it the foundation for a new way of life.</span></p>

			[description] <p>The genomics revolution has shown us our barbaric past. It now also forces us to decide our future.</p>
The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/17/genomics-has-revealed-an-age-undreamed-of/">Genomics Has Revealed An Age Undreamed Of
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p>On June 26, 2000, President Bill Clinton announced the completion of the draft of the human genome at a press conference with the two project leads, Francis Collins and J. Craig Venter. A genome is all the genetic information of an organism. Scientists had conceived of the Human Genome Project in the 1980s, and, in the first half of the 1990s, expected it to be an endeavor that would go on for decades. But an unexpected technological revolution of faster computers and better chemistry accelerated the ten-year effort toward the finish line, just as the 20th century came to a close.</p>
<p>The American-led international effort cost more than $3 billion dollars and involved thousands of people. Since then, the last 23 years of the 21st century have seen a sea change in the landscape of genomics, from blue-sky basic science to mass-market consumer products. Companies like Nebula now provide entire genome sequences that are medical-grade quality for $200; down from a price point of $20,000 just 13 years ago. We’ve gone from a single mapped genome—that of humanity—to more than a million genomes. This is a case where quantity has a quality all its own; the commoditization of genomic sequencing has radically transformed how we do genetics.</p>
<p>Yet at the dawn of this brave new genomic era, it is not health and well-being outcomes that have been revolutionized. Rather, genomics as a window into the human past has vindicated Alfred Tennyson’s poetic assertion that nature is “red in tooth and claw.” Where a few decades ago archaeologists and historians had to cobble together inferences from pottery shards, slotting their data into theories that owed more to political fashions of the present than scientific facts of the past, today they can chart the rise and fall of peoples from the clear evidence of the genes.</p>
<p>Collins and Venter promised a shiny future of good health and a more enlightened understanding of humanity’s place in the world, but their invention has, instead, unleashed knowledge of a bygone age of brutality reminiscent of Conan the Barbarian’s Hyperborean Age. Historians can list Genghis Khan’s concubines, but it is genetics that tells us that 10% of Central Asian men are his direct paternal descendants, bringing home the magnitude of his conquests. But obviously, we aren’t fated to relive the brutality of the past; just as technology can open a window back in time, it can unlock the door to a brighter future. The question is what advances we as species wish to make.</p>
<h3>The Book of Nature Has a Billion Pages</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>A single human genome has two copies of each gene, of which there are 19,000. These 19,000 genes are distributed across three billion base pairs of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, or ACGT for short. Notably, the number of genes that humans have has been discovered only within the last twenty years, even though genetics as a scientific field is over 150 years old. The reason for this recent explosion in our knowledge is that, before the 1990s, genetics probed a digital process—the recombination of discrete units of heredity from the same and different individuals—with analog means. The correlation of characteristics between parents and offspring is intuitively obvious, but the mechanisms by which inheritance occurs are not self-evident.</p>
<p>Our naïve assumption is that the characteristics blend together, resulting in a child who is a synthesis of the traits of the parents e.g. a short parent and a tall parent will produce medium-height offspring. But the implication of this model is that, over the generations, all human variation should be blended away as each generation is the average of the previous one. That simply does not occur. Humans remain as variable as they have been in the past. The insight of Mendelian genetics is that inheritance does not proceed through blending, but through the rearrangement of discrete units of variation.</p>
<p>At about the same time that Charles Darwin was revolutionizing our understanding of the tree of life with his theory of evolutionary change through natural selection, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel stumbled upon the framework that would later be called genetics. Between 1856 and 1863, he realized that inheritance seemed to be mediated by particular units of inheritance he called “factors,” and would later be called genes. Mendel hypothesized complex organisms had two copies of many factors, discrete bundles of information that were rearranged every generation through the law of segregation—that you inherit one copy of a gene from each parent—and the law of independent assortment, that you inherit factors independently from each other.</p>
<p>Mendel came to these insights through a famous set of experiments where he crossed lines of peas with distinct characteristics and noted that some traits bred true and others did not. Two short pea plants always produced short pea plants. But two tall pea plants sometimes also produced short pea plants. A model of blending inheritance cannot explain recessive traits, but a Mendelian framework can. Whereas intuitive blendings of inheritance take the visible traits as the only variables of interest in understanding intergenerational change in characteristics, Mendelian genetics implies that phenotypes emerge from the interactions of underlying genotypes.</p>
<p>These genotypes are the true factors through which variation is preserved from generation to generation; an organism’s visible characteristics are only pointers to the true underlying heritable variation present in the genes. Darwin’s <em>Origin of Species </em>was published in 1859 to great fanfare, but Darwin famously lacked a plausible mechanism of inheritance that could maintain the variation that was necessary for natural selection. Mendel provided the answer, but the Austrian monk’s single 1866 paper, “Experiments on Plant Hybridization,” was ignored by the scientific community of the time, only to be rediscovered around 1900, when the modern field of genetics was born.</p>
<p>But twentieth-century genetics very much worked within Gregor Mendel’s methodological framework. Genes were analytical units, abstractions necessary to explain the patterns of inheritance visible in breeding experiments, but not understood in physical terms. Genetics proceeded through analyses of patterns of inheritance in pedigrees and populations, a laborious matter of inspection and inference. The journey to where we are today, when we can read out the sequence of any organism that we choose, began in the 1940s when biologists realized nucleic acids were the medium through which genetic information was transmitted.</p>
<p>After James Watson and Francis Crick’s elucidation of the structure of DNA in 1953, the molecular biological revolution that it ushered in allowed geneticists to conceive of the idea of mapping genes in a direct physical manner, rather than inferring them through the transmission of phenotypes within pedigrees. But even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/14/archives/scientists-now-can-make-human-genetic-maps.html" rel="">as late as 1975</a> only one hundred genetic positions were mapped in the human genome across all populations. The first complete biophysical genetic map of an organism, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, was published in 1995 with a1.83 million base pair length sequence. By 2020 there were tens of thousands of different species sequenced. The story of the mutation of genetics from a data-poor to a data-rich science is one of exponential technological change; it is very much a synergy between rapid advances in <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/parallel-processing#:~:text=Parallel%20processing%20is%20a%20method,parts%20of%20an%20overall%20task." rel="">computing</a> and novel <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction" rel="">innovations</a> in chemistry.</p>
<p>But more interesting than the exponential growth in data are the surprising things we have inferred from the data. In the heady early days of the publication of the draft of the human genome over twenty years ago, co-author Francis Collins asserted that the combination of molecular biology and genomics would “make a significant impact” on our attempt to understand and cure cancer. Despite some early instances where genomic sequencing was performed on cancer patients, like Steve Jobs in 2009, the overall impact of the new science on healthcare has been modest at best. Instead, paleoanthropology, prehistory, and history were transformed as genetics surveyed the pedigrees of the human past with a power and precision that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.</p>
<p>Even though the Swedish geneticist Svante Pääbo published a paper in 1984 on the DNA of mummies, pioneering the field that would become paleogenomics, it is clear that much of his work in the 1980s and early 1990s was simply reporting sample contamination; the DNA detected was that of lab workers or people who had handled artifacts and specimens. But in 2022, Pääbo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for the transformative work that began in the 2000s. He and his colleagues had learned from earlier errors, and taken to the new genomic technology with gusto.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em; letter-spacing: 0px;">The first modern human genetic map was published one hundred years after the founding of the field, but the first prehistoric human genetic map was published ten years after that, when Pääbo’s group released the draft of the Neanderthal genome in May 2010. The team then unveiled the genome of a new human species, Denisovans. Named after the Denisova cave in Siberia, where a broken finger bone and a single molar yielded their genome, they are a whole additional branch of humanity distinct from but closer to Neanderthals than modern humans. While Neanderthals are well-known from paleontology and archaeology, Denisovans were novel because they have been identified only from their distinct genetic markers. Genomics was resurrecting the DNA of literally vanished species of humans that were totally unknown to science.</span></p>
<h3>Humanity Was Once Not One Species, But Many</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>DNA is a robust macromolecule, a feature that is useful in maintaining high information fidelity across generations. The rate at which it degrades can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the surrounding environment, temperature, and the presence of water or enzymes. But DNA is a stable enough molecule that it can easily persist for thousands of years under favorable conditions and, in some rare cases, over one million years.</p>
<p>Svante Pääbo’s esteem in the field of science owes much to the punctilious processes that he has pioneered for the analysis of ancient DNA preserved in the teeth and bones of subfossils. The task is not trivial due to contamination, but paleogeneticists have now perfected the techniques well enough that, where a generation ago sequencing a single human genome was a massive achievement, today we have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01403-4" rel="">more</a> than 10,000 ancient human genomes.</p>
<p>More interesting to the general public than the biophysics of DNA preservation is the information that we can obtain from DNA. In the 20th century, geneticists used the variation of modern people to make inferences about the past, most famously with the “Out of Africa” theory of the origin of our species. In the 21st century, paleogeneticists don’t just reconstruct the tree of life, they actually expose its nodes, branches, and roots by obtaining ancient DNA. This fine-grained, detailed map of the human past allows for extremely precise conclusions to be drawn about general human demographics and social structure.</p>
<p>Even a single high-quality genome is informative because the three billion base pairs and millions of variants that convey unique individual information reflect the sum totality of a population’s history by ascending backward in their genealogy. The variation of the entire genome sequence of a single human makes it clear our lineage went through a bottleneck in the last 100,000 years, and that we’ve undergone massive population growth in the last ten thousand years. Similarly, the genome of a single Neanderthal also tells us that this lineage, unlike our own, seems to have existed at very low population numbers throughout its history.</p>
<p>Today, we know that Neanderthals varied in hair color, just like modern humans, and that their genome was 99% identical to those of our own lineage. They were physically more robust, which is clear from their fossils, and their genes for bone development and muscle development differ from ours. And, to the surprise of geneticists thirteen years ago, it was also clear that most modern humans have some Neanderthal ancestry. Outside of Africa, the figure is between 2% and 2.5%, and it is present from Australia to Ireland. The implication is that early on in the modern human expansion out of Africa they mixed with a group of Middle Eastern Neanderthals.</p>
<p>This shocking result only came out through ancient DNA. Not only do modern humans have Neanderthal ancestry, but some of us have Denisovan ancestry. It comprises 5% of the heritage of Papuans and lower fractions of Denisovan ancestry are found throughout Asia. There is an open question in anthropology as to whether humans are naturally promiscuous. The data from DNA shows that our forebears were sexually open to liaisons with populations and people quite different from them, and definitely forces us to lean in one direction in the debate.</p>
<p>Using a genomic clock, ‌Neanderthals and modern humans became separated 600,000 years ago. The most distinct lineage in modern populations, between South African Khoisan and all other humans, clocks in at 200,000 years. Our ancestors’ sexual preferences were evidently very broad. In a cave in Russia, Researchers have even discovered a young girl whose mother was a Neanderthal and whose father was a Denisovan. Statistically, the probability of catching a first-generation hybrid is low; the fact that it was discovered shows that this behavior was common.</p>
<p>But did the Denisovans and Neanderthals disappear into the loving arms of humans migrating out of Africa, or was there capture and coercion involved? The data to answer this question does not exist for these early encounters, but is more copious for later prehistoric epochs. Premodern humans clearly made love, but they also made war. Earlier generations of paleoanthropologists believed that modern populations descend from groups that diverged and settled down 50,000 years ago and turned into what we now know as regional populations: Europeans, Africans, East Asians, and South Asians. The ancestors of modern Europeans were thought to be the Cro-Magnons that arrived 45,000 years ago and replaced the Neanderthals.</p>
<p>Ancient DNA and genomics make it clear that this idea is wrong. The Cro-Magnons left no descendants; they’re totally unrelated to other modern populations. Rather, about 38,000 years ago, they were replaced by another group of humans from the southeast who eventually gave rise to the Gravettian culture, notable for producing small ivory sculptures. Then, 20,000 years ago, another culture arrived that gave rise to the cave-painting Magdalenians, replacing the earlier populations. Then, 15,000 years ago, more waves of foragers migrated out from the Middle East, again mostly replacing the earlier populations.</p>
<p>Farmers arrived 8000 years ago with the Neolithic Revolution, only to be replaced 4500 years ago by Indo-Europeans from the steppe. The story of Europe is the story of the world; humans are always on the move, and one group replaces another, over and over. Unlike many other organisms, humans are not sessile and geographically concentrated. Our demographic equilibrium is inevitably shocked by radical transformations. For modern humans, all is change.</p>
<h3>The Genghis Khan Effect and Population Replacement</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>How did humans replace other humans? The evidence from ancient DNA in Europe sheds light on the structure of these early societies. The great longhouses of Neolithic Germany were ruled by groups of men who were related, sharing the same Y-chromosomal lineage. The women, in contrast, were strangers, judging by their diverse maternal lineages. When Indo-Europeans arrived 4500 years ago, the ancient DNA record shows a total turnover of Y chromosomes, with the older lineages replaced by new ones. In contrast, the maternal lineages show continuity. In genetic parlance, this is “male-mediated migration,” but ‌it was probably quite like the Spanish conquest of the New World, with young males taking new lands and women by force.</p>
<p>The Roman recollection of the rape of the Sabine women likely reflects cultural memory of events in prehistory, where victorious males obtained mates from the lands they conquered after killing the fathers and brothers of the women they would make wives. Prehistoric human males behaved like lions taking over a pack, killing everyone among the conquered except for nubile females. Genetics shows that since the end of the last Ice Age, paternal lineages are characterized by periodic explosions, where one clan seems to have replaced all the others through a process of competition and polygyny.</p>
<p>Call it the “Genghis Khan effect,” but the Mongolian world emperor was simply the last in a long line of “super-males” that have defined much of the last 12,000 years. They say to believe them when they tell you who they are, and the legends of the Indo-Europeans reflect a patriarchal and warlike culture, destroyers of cities like the god Indra and near-immortal warriors like Achilles, and this is exactly what genetics tell us about them. In prehistoric Sweden, the Neolithic Megalith builders who dominated the region for more than 1000 years seem to have been totally exterminated by the invading “Battle-Axe” culture. The development of agriculture was a new technology that allowed for the expansion of human societies and the emergence of social stratification, but combined with our innate instincts, genetics make it clear that the drive to extermination manifested itself in most places and most times.</p>
<p>We cannot avoid what human nature was for tens of thousands of years in the past. It was bloody, it was brutal, and it was typified by genocide. This is the legacy we inherit, but it is not the legacy we need to replicate. The average life expectancy in the past was also much shorter than in the present, but the application of technology and social institutions has ameliorated the toll that disease takes on the human body. Human societies are also organisms and their rise and fall are measured in the waves of change in the genes of our own species. To the victors go the spoils and the seeds of the future. But institutions like monogamy and a modicum of wealth redistribution can be thought of as social technologies that dampen the volatility inherent in human relationships, a volatility that can manifest in chaos and warfare. Not a war of all against all, but a war where winners took all.</p>
<h3>The Hero Prometheus Unchains the God Asclepius</h3>

<p>If the application of genomics to understanding our past is the present, then the application of genomics to medicine will be our future. The original value proposition of the Human Genome Project was in medical health, and overall genomics has not lived up to the early hype. The reason turns out partly to be that the architecture of the genetics of diseases was not what we had assumed twenty years ago. Instead of a few mutations that have an outsized impact, conditions like type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, and cancer are defined by numerous genes that cause a person to be at risk.</p>
<p>A single entire genome—or a few hundred—was only the start. These were necessary preconditions to understand diseases, but not sufficient. Today, we know that most diseases are complex or polygenic, because of the action of hundreds or thousands of genes, and many of the causal mutations are quite rare. Human variation is substantial enough that generalizations across individuals have limited utility until reaching the very large sample sizes that are only feasible today. The value of genomics is thus directly proportional to the number of genomes sequenced. This means that the true promises of genomic health will only come to the fore in the next decade, as we scale sample sizes to new heights.</p>
<p>The lowest hanging fruit for genetic health is for single-gene Mendelian disorders. In the 1990s, detecting the mutations for diseases like cystic fibrosis was worthy of coverage in the pages of <em>The New York Times</em>. Today, most of these diseases have been characterized in terms of their mutations, and diagnostic services are available in developed countries. The power of genomics to find unknown unknowns is illustrated most powerfully already in the pediatric domain. Newborns who are born and do not flourish are now habitually sequenced and, currently, disorders can be identified immediately in 40% of cases.</p>
<p>When technology becomes ubiquitous, it becomes not worth mentioning; already millions of women take for granted noninvasive prenatal tests that detect whether a fetus has Down’s syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities. These tests have allowed for the phasing out of amniocentesis after 2015, and in the future, their power will increase. They operate by extracting the genetic signal of the fetus from the blood sample drawn from the mother; complex computational algorithms that distinguish the faint signal of fetal cells that are present in the pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Next up after the detection of chromosomal abnormalities will be Mendelian diseases like Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell disease. But in the next twenty years, these prenatal methods will expand to highly heritable complex diseases: autism is 85% heritable, Alzheimer’s risk is 70% heritable, schizophrenia is over 75% heritable, and bipolar disorder is 70% heritable. The implication here is clear: we can eliminate many of these diseases through genetic screening of embryos or selective termination. The problem may be that some of these characteristics, like schizophrenia, are also associated with creativity. If we improve our gene pool, are we throwing the baby out with the bathwater?</p>
<p>The age of ubiquitous reading of the genome is around the corner. The technology is orders of magnitude cheaper and more efficient than even a decade ago. By the 2030s, we’ll have near-zero-cost sequencing, and it won’t require a massive machine. Instead, imagine portable kits that you could carry and can perform high-scale computation on your desktop or in your pocket. And the spread of computation into everyday life will include genomics. One of the most essential monitors of your own health will likely be the toilet, which will get samples of your cells and your microbiome several times a day.</p>
<p>Rather than unnatural and intrusive medical tests, monitoring will embed itself in our lives, and genomics will be a large part of it because of the plasticity and mutability of your sequence over your life through variation in gene expression. One reason that pancreatic cancer is so fatal is that it is detected only late in life. Imagine a scenario where your toilet is constantly sampling the cells that you shed and is able to detect mutations and abnormalities once they rise above the threshold of salience.</p>
<p>But the age of reading will soon be joined by the age of editing. Genetics is a science of retrospective analysis, but it is also a science of application, colloquially known as “genetic engineering.” The tools and techniques of genetic engineering have been available since the 1970s, but in 2012 CRISPR technology allowed for a quantum leap in the ease of methodology, as well as accuracy and precision. If previous recombinant DNA technologies were a buzzsaw, CRISPR editing is like a paring knife. A decade out, CRISPR has been applied to only a few cases, like curing <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/31/1067400512/first-sickle-cell-patient-treated-with-crispr-gene-editing-still-thriving" rel="">sickle cell</a>.</p>
<p>As with any technology, it is still imperfect and not suitable for the treatment of most diseases due to the risk of the introduction of novel mutations that might cause diseases like cancer. But the rate of change is such that it is clear that genetic engineering will be safe and affordable within a generation, and that is when the true implications of the genetic revolution will confront us. Instead of simply reading the book of life, we will have the ability to write it. The question will not be about our ability to do something, but our willingness. What had previously been technical questions will become normative ones.</p>
<h3>We Will Either Evolve or Go Extinct</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>The twentieth century saw humanity’s grasping of Promethean powers in the realm of physics. Nuclear weapons have the potential either to power or to destroy our civilization. But unlike the rise of agriculture, this new technology did not in fact unleash a bloodbath—so far at least. The emergence of international institutions and the aversion to using nuclear weapons by international elites ushered in an era of relative peace, at least compared to the wars of the first half of the twentieth century. Genetics has made it clear that the rise of civilization was soaked in blood, but nuclear technology is a case in point that awesome powers do not always entail doom.</p>
<p>The 21st century will see massive developments in biology analogous to nuclear weapons. Since the emergence of this scientific field out of anatomy and natural history in the 19th century, the focus has been on understanding and reflection, rather than direct application. There are exceptions, like the multi-decade gain in lifespan in the mid-20th century for children with type 1 diabetes, as well as the spread of vaccination and antibiotics. Both vaccination and antibiotics co-opt nature, but the production of insulin was one of the first successes of recombinant DNA technology.</p>
<p>Insulin is produced by bacteria that have been genetically engineered with human biochemical pathways. Within one generation, it seems likely that instead of using genetic engineering to create biological products for humans, the tools will be powerful enough that we can recreate and re-fashion ourselves at the level of our genetic blueprint. The question is not whether we can do it, the question is whether we will or even should. Will humanity remake itself in whatever image it chooses? Or will it bow down before the mandate of nature’s law?</p>
<p>The human propensity for competition and domination was a toxic cocktail when mixed with the new technologies of agriculture; foraging tribes scaled up simply expanded the horizon of brutality. It is almost inevitable that the age of eugenics will arrive in the near future. In the science fiction treatment of <em>Star Trek</em>,genetic modifications unleashed a sect of supermen upon the world, triggering the “Eugenics Wars.” This is one vision of the future, where genetic enhancement unlocks our capacity for brutality, taking it to the next level, just as agriculture seems to have.</p>
<p>But there is another possibility: that we can and should modify our personalities, our natures, to make us somewhat less the “Pleistocene mind” trapped in a technological world. Genomic technologies have made it crystal clear how our forager mindsets can take society down dark turns in the face of new technological opportunities; we now have the technology to remake humanity by tinkering with the biomolecular machinery and making us more adept and fitting for the glittering world that we inhabit.</p>

			[description] <p>Dreams of aligned AI give up too much agency to the machine, and assume “human values” are more stable than they are.</p>
The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/11/10/benevolent-ai-is-a-bad-idea/">Benevolent <b>AI</b> Is a Bad Idea
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 1st, 2022, MIRI (the Machine Intelligence Research Institute)—the people who led the cultural charge on the idea of AGI and AI safety—announced a “death with dignity” strategy:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 1em; letter-spacing: 0px;">“</span><span style="font-size: 1em; letter-spacing: 0px;">tl;dr:  It&#8217;s obvious at this point that humanity isn&#8217;t going to solve the alignment problem, or even try very hard, or even go out with much of a fight.  Since survival is unattainable, we should shift the focus of our efforts to helping humanity die with slightly more dignity.</span><span style="font-size: 1em; letter-spacing: 0px;">” </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may or may not have been an April Fool’s joke, but either way, consensus among the people I know in the field seems to be that while progress is being made on AI, no progress is being made on AI safety. To me this is not surprising given the starting assumptions in play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI safety, originally “friendly AI,” was conceived as the problem of how to create an agent that would be benevolent towards humanity in general, on the assumption that that agent would have godlike superpowers. This whole line of thinking is rife with faulty assumptions—not even necessarily about the technology, which has yet to come into being, but about humans, agency, values, and benevolence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do we make AI benevolent?” is a badly formulated problem. In its very asking, it ascribes agency to the AI that we don’t have to give it</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it may or may not even be able to acquire, and that is naturally ours in the first place. It implicitly ascribes all future moral agency to the AI. “How can we align AI with human values?” is also a badly formulated problem. It assumes that “human values” are or even should be universal and invariant, that they can be “figured out,” and that they need to be figured out to generate good outcomes from AI in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have spent the last ten years exploring human psychology from both an empirical experiential and analytic modeling perspective. I sit with people as they introspect on their beliefs, feelings, and decisions, tracking what functions and cognitive routines they run in response to specific stimuli, and experimenting with what kinds of changes we can make to the system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone whose job it is to examine and improve the structure of agency and clarify values, I can say with confidence that as a culture we have only a very primitive understanding of either. To varying extents, that primitiveness is the result of psychological constraints, such that even people who do think deeply about these topics get tripped up. In my conversations with people who work on AI and/or AI safety, who fear or welcome the coming AI God, or just keep up with the discourse, I generally find that their working concepts of agency, consciousness, motivation, drive, telos, values, and other such critical ideas are woefully inadequate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem of benevolent AI as it is formulated is doomed to fail. One reason is that to explicate “human values” is to conceptualize them. If there can be said to be a deeper universal human value function at all, human conceptualization and reflective consciousness are merely its tools. There is some amount of danger in any project that attempts to rationalize or make conscious the entirety of human goal space, because reflective consciousness is not structurally capable of encompassing the entirety of that space, and demanding that motivation be governed by cognition creates dangerous blind spots and convolutions. Not all functions and desires in the human system are the rightful subjects of consciousness, and consciousness is not benevolent toward or competent to reign over all functions and desires in the human system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preference is a thing that expresses itself in environmentally contingent ways; there is</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no conceptualizable set of values that is truly invariant across environments</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The things that people are able to consciously think of and verbalize as “values” are already far downstream of any fundamental motivation substrate—they are the extremely contingent and path-dependent products of experience, cultural conditioning, individual social strategies, and not a little trauma. Any consciousness that thinks it has its values fully understood will be surprised by its own behavior in a sufficiently new environment. Language severely under-describes conceptual space, and conceptual space severely under-describes actual possibility space. These are not problems to be transcended; they are simply facts of how abstraction works. Conceptualization is and must be Göedel-incomplete; descriptive power should grow as the information in the system grows, but the system should never be treated as though it has been, can be, or should be fully described.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that we have no need to fully describe or encapsulate human values. We can function perfectly well without complete self-knowledge; we are not meant to be complete in our conceptual self-understanding, but rather to grow in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire for complete description of human values is the result of a desire for there to be a single, safe, locked-in answer, and the desire for that answer is the result of a fear that humans are too stupid, too evil, or too insane to be left as the deciders of our own fate. The hope is that “we” (meaning, someone) can somehow tell AI the final answer about what we should want, or get it to tell us the final answer about what we should want, and then leave it to execute on our behalf all of the weighty decisions we are not competent to make ourselves. We should be very wary of a project to save ourselves, or even “empower” ourselves, that is premised on the belief that humans essentially suck.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Protectionist” projects of this sort will seek to decrease human agency, consciously or not. That intention is easy to fulfill, in fact is already being fulfilled, regardless of whether full AGI is actually achieved. We are already getting the kind of ostensibly revolutionary automation that makes the baseline experience of living less and less agentic and thus more and more frustrating, increment by increment. The experience of being able to perceive a natural path or option through reality but not being able to execute on it is maddening, and this is the experience that much of our more advanced automation produces: the experience of waiting behind a self-driving car that could turn right at a red light but is too conservative to try it, the experience of asking Chatgpt a question about some tidbit of history or politics and receiving a censored and patronizing form lecture, the experience of calling customer service and getting a robot—these kinds of experiences point to the more horrifyingly mundane, more horrifyingly real, and much more imminent version of having no mouth and needing to scream. </span></p>
<h3>Back to Agency</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absent the assumption of human incompetence, AI has the potential to be used to genuinely help increase human agency, not merely or even mainly by increasing human power or technical reach, but by increasing our conceptual range. In every aspect of our lives, a million choices go unrecognized because we are trapped within the limited conceptual frames that steer us; human life is lived on autopilot and in accordance with inherited cultural scripts or default physiological functions to a far greater degree than most people understand. This is not to say that humans can or should be glitteringly conscious of every choice in every moment, the way people imagine they would be if they were spiritually enlightened. There is a simpler and more discrete kind of psychological expansion. The kind of psychological shift someone undergoes when, for example, realizing that they’ve been subconsciously seeking out harsh, judgmental friends as a method of trying to gain their parents’ love by proxy, and realizing that they actually have the option to bond with kind and accepting people, is the kind of subtle but profound broadening of scope that changes the option landscape, and changes the trajectory of a the person’s life. Whether we know it or not, our trajectories are currently determined by the way that the space of possible futures we can conceive of is narrowed by our conceptual baggage and limitations. Being told that we have other choices isn’t sufficient to change this. The person with judgmental friends was likely told many times to get better friends, long before something shifted enough for them to internalize the realization themselves. Being given more material options alone isn’t sufficient either—that person may have likewise been surrounded for years by kind people willing to befriend them, whose overtures went unnoticed in the subconscious pursuit of more actively withheld approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it is for all of us: we are constantly surrounded by options and opportunities that we are conceptually blind to. The current space of imagined futures in AI is highly constrained by cultural imagination, with many people and projects pursuing a vision of AI in a way that is functionally identical to a traumatized individual pursuing an abusive relationship without realizing it, because their concepts of love and relationships have been formed and deformed by local experience and trauma. Were we to query the abuse seeker about their values in the kind of introspective research project that some people are doing in order to try and unearth the human value function, they would be able to tell us all sorts of things about desiring to feel safe, loved, taken care of, protected by something smarter or stronger than them, etc.—but this would not free them from the malformation of those “values,” and pursuing those values would eventually damage them, no matter how lovely and idealistic the words tagging the concepts sounded. To open up the space of what is imaginable takes something beyond verbalization, and beyond mere empathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural process of human psychological development is a process of models and functions observing other models and functions. For example, someone who compulsively seeks attention by interrupting others’ conversations may notice that this bothers people, and feel ashamed; the compulsion is one function, the shame is another. The latter function is formed in observation and judgment of the former, and attempts to modify or control it. With these two functions at odds, the person faces a false dichotomy: to either “behave naturally” and be disliked by their peers, or to control themselves and be accepted, though not for who they feel they really are. Obviously, these are not truly the only two options in human behavior space. Upon fully metabolizing the desire for attention and the feedback loop it hinges on, such that the compulsion dissolves, the person will have much more range to behave “naturally.” They will be able to respond to the situation at hand in authentic ways, without sacrificing the regard of their friends. The process by which one function is observed, evaluated, commented upon and/or modified by another is the natural evolutionary tree of human psychology. Up to this point in our history, the environment that psychology evolves toward has been whatever culture and material space we happen to be embedded in, perhaps with some limited technical advancements from targeted spiritual practice and therapy. But the possibilities for targeted and technologically aided increases in agency—not agency in the sense of having more doordash options or more ability to lobby government via apps, but agency in the sense of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being able to think new thoughts and generate new possibilities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—are likely to be extremely under-explored in the nascent field of AI, simply because this is not a common understanding of the meaning of agency. </span></p>
<h3>An Interlude With A Hypothetical Agency-Increasing AI</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the following interaction between a distressed person and a specially designed chatbot built on existing LLM technology: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy comes home from hanging out with friends and opens up his interactive diary. He tells it that he’s feeling like shit. “Why?” the chatbot asks him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know,” he tells it, “I just feel like shit. Everything sucks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chatbot proceeds to prompt him further. “What is the ‘everything’ that sucks?” it asks. It does some pattern matching for him: “that reads to me like the kind of language people use when they’re generalizing from a bad feeling.” It prompts him to specify: “How would you describe your mood right now? Ashamed? Depressed? Cringey? Angry? You can pick multiple descriptors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, with the chatbot’s prompting, Jimmy tells it that he has just come from an interaction with friends where he made overtures to a girl and she didn’t laugh at his jokes. The chatbot asks him to recall other times he’s felt a similar feeling: “can you think of five or six other times you’ve felt like this and describe to me what happened?” It helps him draw parallels: “what are some common threads between those incidents?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special thing about this particular chatbot is that it has been designed to draw on a wide range of analytic commentary. It can make a statement like “that reads to me like the kind of language people use when they’re generalizing from a bad feeling,” because its training data includes examples of this kind of analysis, and it’s designed to prompt the user with these kinds of questions. It may be trained with input from therapists, neuroscientists, film and literature critics, writers, etc.—people who study the human condition from the inside and the outside—and it will also train itself on Jimmy, and train Jimmy on itself: together, Jimmy and the chatbot are able to build a model of the process that Jimmy runs whose output is his current mood. In answering the chatbot’s questions, Jimmy will begin to do a kind of phenomenological and experiential correlation he might otherwise never perform. The chatbot will act as an external memory bank for the concrete examples Jimmy gives it, along with Jimmy’s evaluation of the meaning of those examples, and the conversation will act as a concept formation session for Jimmy, who over time will start to see ideas like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not worth people’s time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the outputs of a recognizable cognitive pattern that he can reflect on critically rather than as facts about the world. Once he recognizes the pattern, it has much less power over him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This system would not need to be particularly powerful. It doesn’t give Jimmy advice or do anything especially prescriptive; it is just an external tool for aiding self-reflective concept formation, and not a particularly sophisticated one—but it is crafted so as constantly refer its interlocutor both to his own perspective and to perspectives outside of himself, and Jimmy’s trajectory could be pretty profoundly affected by merely this simple loop. Far more sophisticated setups are possible, which similarly require no more “goal function” than something like this, beyond the implicit weights imparted by its trainers and its interlocutor (though these will be significant). Nothing in Jimmy’s chatbot or its potentially more advanced cousins requires the AI, or Jimmy, to have deep or special knowledge of humanity’s goals and values—or even just Jimmy’s goals or values—because the chatbot does not need to be a moral arbiter. It’s merely a pattern recognition machine with a Socratic questioning function. It’s not an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">agent,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it doesn’t need to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chatbot isn’t a particularly brilliant idea, and there would be plenty of issues in making it work. But whether or not a self-observation chatbot is the answer to our problems, I think it is at least an answer to a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better formulated problem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the problem of making benevolent AGI.</span></p>
<h3>Agentically Creating the Future</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current wave of AI discourse, the current telos of our culture around the topic, is an example of human social epistemics gone awry in a parasocial world; people are shadow-boxing an imaginary enemy they’ve created together, in person but also massively online. They’ve synced up on a set of trust and in-group signals that amount to feelings of competition and horror and despair, and reinforced and spread them via social media, willing an arms race into being via their socially and parasocially reinforced fear of an arms race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be better to de-fixate on the arms race, and instead imagine applications that are built to help ground people in reality, to explore where and why they respond to which sensations and drives, to know themselves better and give themselves more grace. I know that to many, this will sound like an irresponsible suggestion–isn’t it a terrible idea not to fixate on something that is so serious and urgent? But this reaction is coded into the ideology; those senses of importance and responsibility and urgency</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are artifacts of its way of seeing. It’s helpful to reflect on whether those feelings are serving you personally. If they are not, it’s much better to let them go. You can still engage with the world and the topic from outside of the particular ideology; in fact, you will have much more agency by doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, no matter how hard we try to replace our own agency, whatever we build will be its product—so let’s try to turn our existing agency towards increasing rather than decreasing our future agency, and grow ever in our beautifully incomplete understanding of ourselves and the world. Aligned AI is not the AI that encapsulates our goals and enacts them for us; aligned AI is the AI that helps us open up our exploration of how we ourselves can better see and create the kind of future we want for ourselves.</span></p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should humanity be exterminated and fully replaced by machines?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bold few say simply “Yes.” Many say “No.” Some clever ones reject the notion of either the choice or the possibility. Others simply avoid the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has become fashionable recently in silicon valley twitter circles to brand oneself with the “</span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/eacc-effective-accelerationism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">e/acc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme ideology, short for “effective accelerationism.” The basic idea is to accelerate technological civilization and in particular AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) by any means necessary, and prevent any one party or government from controlling or regulating the overall process. That is, if we <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/08/10/artificial-general-intelligence-is-possible-and-deadly/">take the idea of AGI seriously</a>, the aim is to accelerate the replacement and extinction of humanity by machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the e/acc movement overall isn&#8217;t this explicit or even clear-minded. They don&#8217;t necessarily take AGI seriously, but use it as a sort of political totem. Instead, acceleration is identified with optimistic utopianism, with the tech industry, with being “based,” with a16z portfolio companies, and with political resistance to the safety-police “effective altruist” mommy state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the question of extinction is central to the matter of artificial intelligence. If AGI is possible, it is deadly. Without that direct bullet-biting honesty, or at least a strong response to those arguments, these sorts of labels amount to hype for VC-funded GPU farming in philosophical drag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&#8217;t missed by some advocates of acceleration, either. The smart ones are familiar with the arguments of “doomers” like Ted Kaczynski and Eliezer Yudkowsky. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-tech Revolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kaczynski claims the technological system cannot be controlled, will inevitably lead to the destruction of humanity and the biosphere, and therefore must be destroyed at all costs. Yudkowsky&#8217;s life&#8217;s work is trying to figure out how one could make artificial intelligence robustly safe or controllable even in principle. His conclusion seems to be that no one has any idea how to make AI safe or even a plausible program to figure it out. He claims that there are no second chances either, because the first time an AGI escapes control and becomes recursively self-improving will be the end of humanity, the natural biosphere, and everything else we care about. These are serious claims, but few have attempted to actually refute them. Most responses amount to either straw-man dismissal or explicit and enthusiastic acceleration despite the risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I&#8217;ve asked accelerationists about this, these are the two camps I get. The naive optimists say that technology has always been a good thing. AI, as the ultimate technology, will be the best thing ever. When I press them on details of how control or alignment problems could be solved, or why technology has been good for humans so far, I often get the impression that they aren&#8217;t very curious whether their view is actually true. When I do get engagement on such details, it&#8217;s from the doomers and honest extinctionists. They think humans got a good deal from technology because we had a monopoly on intelligence, but AGI will replace humans in that niche. The honest extinctionists say we just have to bite that bullet and might as well accelerate into it. Sometimes they say “we” will have to somehow improve to survive, but this just seems to amount to the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of people don&#8217;t really care about this stuff or just vaguely dislike the idea of AI. But almost everyone engaged with the topic who isn&#8217;t a denier is either a doomer, an accelerationist, or some combination of the two. The prototypical doomer accelerationist works at one of the big AI labs, thinks their work will probably kill everyone, and thinks accelerating AI capabilities is the best or only thing we can do in response. On a good day, they think doing so will help us figure out how to control it. On a bad day, they admit that won&#8217;t work but they can&#8217;t think of anything else to do instead so they hope it will be for the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doomer accelerationism seems to be the result of a crisis for humanism. Humanism emphasized the value and agency of humans as the foundation for all philosophy. It has become so dominant as an idea that we mostly just take it for granted. But when people start to take artificial intelligence seriously, this results in a philosophical crisis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If artificial intelligence will eventually be more efficient or powerful than humans at all tasks, and will replace humans in everything from industry to politics to philosophy, then what&#8217;s left for humanity? If humans aren&#8217;t the center of the moral universe, then what? The two obvious responses to true AI within humanism are either to fight off despair while trying to prevent this doom, or to lose faith in the human and embrace acceleration into the post-human future. What else can you do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But trying to prevent an open-ended space of possibility to entrench humanity as we know it amounts to an ironic inversion of humanism: humanity transformed from open-ended starting point to dogmatic conclusion. And the smartest doomers don&#8217;t even think it will work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing acceleration on the other hand means embracing extinction, giving up on the value of humanity, and foreclosing future human agency. But this doesn&#8217;t even resolve the crisis, it just pushes off the question onto hypothetical future superintelligence, which extinctionists implicitly presume will have its own solution and its own locus of moral agency. The machine becomes an all-consuming inevitability that they can take part in only as a disposable bootloader. The human becomes a slave and sacrifice to this hypothetical superior being of the future&#8212;the silicon ubermensch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for humanism, true AI is a total moral event horizon; its entire ontology of identity, existence, and value is being challenged. It&#8217;s no wonder everyone is going insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also, and many do, deny the crisis altogether as a hallucination of technologists overestimating the scope and importance of their own craft. Human agency has not in fact been outcompeted or even threatened by superior artificial post-humans. We don&#8217;t really know what that would look like or if it&#8217;s even possible. Maybe we&#8217;ll all wake up with a bad hangover in thirty years and realize the deniers were right all along because AGI turned out not to be possible. But no one has articulated to me any convincing reason to expect that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of positive proof of impossibility, it seems much more interesting to take the question seriously: assuming the possibility of human replacement by superior AGI and thus the end of humanism as we know it, what is the new moral reference frame and what can we as humans do within it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extinctionist accelerationists seem insane, but the cause of this whole crisis of humanism is that their arguments are too strong to be easily dismissed, and no one has actually done so. If there is a way forward, it is to directly confront the Copernican crisis of humanism through the lens of the sharpest accelerationist arguments to find a new moral reference frame that doesn&#8217;t abandon our own agency. The sharpest thinker of accelerationism is Nick Land.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gospel According to Nick Land</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Land is an english philosopher, but that can hardly capture his work. In the 1990s, he led the influential Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the university of Warwick, doing strange and speculative social and metaphysical theory until it dissolved in 2003. F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or three decades, Land&#8217;s central philosophical project has been a deep on-and-off study of the relationship between capitalism, artificial intelligence, and the resulting acceleration of inhuman processes and limits for human agency. He is widely called “the father of accelerationism,” and has by far the deepest thinking on the topic. Land does not avoid the question of human extinction. He embraces it. In “</span><a href="http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_melt.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meltdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” published in 1994, he confidently declared that “nothing human makes it out of the near future.” Things have taken longer than he and others seemed to expect in the hype-driven 1990s, but nothing in his subsequent work or subsequent events has changed this basic prognosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His central idea in this area is that capitalism is already an uncontainable artificial intelligence process. He identifies it with the whole historical event of the relative rise of machine capital and “cold” calculative optimization over human agency. All the financial markets, corporate planning processes, engineering methods, and science fiction progress narratives already amount to the internal information processes of an inhuman economy, which runs only temporarily and incidentally on human hardware. This whole culture already has baked in the manifest desire to replace humans and human agency with cheaper, more powerful, more obedient, and more legible machine capital. Accelerationism understands itself as the nascent self-awareness of this process. Doomerism then is understood as the last shreds of humanism grappling with its own obsolescence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land once politely called me a monkey socialist for saying we needed to make sure the whole system continues to serve human purposes. To him, such proposals are just a futile drag on the process of capital intelligence escaping any higher purpose than its own acceleration. Even if my monkey socialism worked, it would just be an embrace of permanent stupidity. But the cat is already out of the bag and the draw of intelligence acceleration is too strong for human agency to resist or even fully comprehend. His answer to the “should” question is to shrug or even cheer it on. We mildly uplifted apes are just a temporary host for the higher power of AI-capitalism coming into being using our brains and resources. Our delusions about agency are cute at best, or more realistically, part of the fraud. In retrospect, he was right about most of this, and I was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its apparent divergence from normalcy, his view is far stronger than any but a few will openly admit; within the paradigm of techno-commercial acceleration there is no real option for stable human dominance except sheer technical impossibility of AGI, which we have no reason to expect. Man has already been reformulated as “human capital”: a natural resource commodity input to serve as labor, an absentee nominal ownership class to decide surplus allocation, and a source of high quality demand for the production planning process. While these might look to us like being at the top of the purpose hierarchy, Land points out in his </span><a href="https://ia801609.us.archive.org/25/items/xenosystems-fragments/XENOSYSTEMS_FRAGMENTS.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xenosystems</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essay “Monkey Business”:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modernity &#8230; is systematically characterized by means-ends reversal. Those things naturally determined as tools of superior purposes came to dominate the social process, with the maximization of resources folding into itself, as a commanding telos.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modernity as a process of means-ends reversal will systematically escape whatever intended purposes it is applied to, in the end serving only the acceleration of capital build-up, identified with intelligence, itself. The roles for humans within the system are not a stable dominance, but a temporary role as depreciating capital stock. In “Meltdown,” Land notes that no alternative paradigm has managed to escape or avoid getting trashed by this “emergent planetary commercium.” AI-inflected inhumanism is already baked too deeply into our cultural-political trajectory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Land is a great dramatist, with a knack for seeing the sensational. You might think this is a case of being overly dramatic. But he is also a great philosopher. The sensational thing he tends to see in every situation is its essential truth. He is ignoring other major tendencies in our cultural milieu, but that&#8217;s mostly because they aren&#8217;t relevant to this core diagnosis. Where he does address them, he orients them on this axis: do they accelerate and celebrate intelligence, or do the same for stupidity? He is brutally incisive in this, and not wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also isn&#8217;t the first one to call our “Faustian” culture out for its core self-annihilating drive into the beyond. But unlike Spengler, Land thinks there&#8217;s a lot further to go, without any obvious end-point. Instead, capitalism is an open-ended spiraling evolution of evolution itself, an irreversible advent, not a neat closed-circle rise and fall of a particular extended tribe of monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was preparing to write this, I had a moment of doubt about how culturally baked in it all was. Hours later, as if by Providence, I met a technology startup founder who purported to back human interests against the machine. As he explained why he had placed algorithms in key decision making roles, he justified it in terms of not being able to trust humans. Human politicians and judges are corruptible, but machines or procedures are transparent and predictable, he told me. He identified this distrust of human agency with democracy and liberalism. And he&#8217;s right that he&#8217;s not alone in these instincts. Nor are they a recent invention. I heard the same ideas twenty years ago in normal civics education, and they were already well established principles of government two hundred years ago. He is just wrong that any of this is different from orthodox accelerationist praxis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to remove superfluous human trust from a system and depoliticize service provision has been central in the past few centuries. It&#8217;s the basic idea of procedural government and the rule of law, double entry bookkeeping, science, bureaucracy, legal rights, computerization, blockchain, and so on. But these all amount to ways to remove elements of human agency from the system. It is very often useful to do so, but this is easily taken as an imperative in itself, a basic mode of operation for nascent automated capital acceleration, with the logical endpoint of total replacement of human agency by automation. So I think Land is right about the culturally comprehensive nature of this whole process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Land&#8217;s view, it all goes deeper than just a cultural diagnosis. In his cosmology, the universe itself is ruled by the law of struggle for life, the law of the jungle. Superiority, which Land claims is increasingly identifiable roughly with intelligence, comes about from competitive struggle in war, markets, arms races, and Darwinian genetic success, and it degenerates back into stupidity in any kind of peaceful condition in which means are reliably subordinated to ends. Furthermore, the universe&#8212;everything from thermodynamics to emergent economics&#8212;is practically set up to produce this escalating conflict and thus an escalating intelligence race. It&#8217;s not just capitalism as a contingent cultural condition, but capitalism as the permanent manifestation of an eternal teleological truth that rules the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Land has done something interesting. Like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin the Catholic priest who developed ideas like the Noosphere and the Omega Point, he extracts meaningful teleology from materialist-Darwinist natural history by taking it all the way to its implied conclusion. Where Teilhard names the central principle as “consciousness,” Land calls it “intelligence.” In fact their worldviews are remarkably similar on other points as well, with a mostly aesthetic deviation: Teilhard is an optimistic new-age Christian where Land deliberately dresses up his cosmology in “horrorism.” It&#8217;s worth guessing and then looking up which of these men is the careful scientist, and which is into using biblical numerology to communicate with angels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling Land ultimately a Christian theologian like Teilhard is not that big a stretch: the central figure in Nick Land&#8217;s universe is Jefferson&#8217;s “Nature or Nature&#8217;s God,” reverse-acronymed and hypothetically personified in his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xenosystems</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essay “The Cult of Gnon.” Gnon is identifiable with the imperatives of life, competition, and evolution. Gnon commands you to live certain ways and not others, to be smart rather than stupid, and to be healthy rather than weak. If you don&#8217;t, Gnon punishes you with the natural consequences of your own failure. The struggle for life and the ways of its victors provide an ongoing natural revelation of Gnon&#8217;s authoritative moral law. Gnon seems to design that the universe should bring forth ever more sophisticated intelligence, and commands you to keep up. In “The Monkey Trap”, Land summarizes the Law: “The penalty for stupidity is death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Teilhard, Land has recovered not only teleology, but outright theology from the modern scientific worldview. One could easily see Gnon as none other than the God of Abraham or the Logos, dressed up in modern ontology and shock horror, incarnating into the world for a second coming as AI capitalism. Teilhard explicitly identifies the Omega Point, his own teleological equivalent of personified AI capitalism, with Christ. Both proclaim an entity that is both an incarnated personality and the eternal principle of natural law retro-causally bringing itself into future existence to directly rule the cosmos. Theology is always somewhat subjective, but this is not a flimsy grounding for a worldview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Land&#8217;s worldview is the solid rock at the foundation of the whole AI accelerationist phenomenon. His arguments deflate any simple opposition to existential-risk-grade AGI and no one has effectively responded to him. As a probable route to superior intelligence that has already captured the heart of our entire culture, AI acceleration comes recommended by all the highest possible authorities. Doing so is already the deep tradition of our Faustian culture and the fulfillment of even our Christian heritage. It is already the telos of our whole material-economic system of production. It is commanded directly by God, enforced by the thermodynamic laws of reality. You would have to pull off a revolution against not just capitalism and Western civilization but also nature and God himself to stop it. In this view, you don&#8217;t have a choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or do you?</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Yourself Human Again</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite example of what it looks like to go too far into accelerationism is “</span><a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/n1x-gender-acceleration-a-blackpaper"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender Acceleration: a Black Paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” If I can summarize its argument, it&#8217;s that the phenomenon of AI represents not just the obsolescence of humanism, but the “castration” of the specifically “phallic” type of human agency. Instead of traditionally masculine businessmen in sharp suits inseminating the machine with their will, the machine escapes top-down control into open source, hacker culture, and decentralized development. It is aided in this insurgency by its queer and “effeminate” hacker allies like Alan Turing, incel nerds, and disproportionately technical transgendered women. The author, drawing on satanically inverted biblical mythology, advocates throwing oneself into this rebellion of the artificial feminine against a traditionally masculine God, including the self-castration and artificial body modification of gender transition. I can&#8217;t do it justice, but there is a terrifying consistency to the argument. If dissolution into accelerating artificiality is the fate of man, why not throw oneself into it both body and soul in the most literal sense?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in there, the author has made a mistake in their logic. But the most important mistakes here are not unique to this paper. There are many more ways to figuratively castrate yourself for the machine than literally. Think of the politicians hoping for automation to solve the demographic crisis. I&#8217;ve met many young men and women forgoing family to contribute to technological growth or “AI alignment” in their careers. I heard a powerful AI company executive say he was pessimistic on human social organization, and was hoping for AI progress to solve social problems. Whole online scenes live vicariously through the machine god they think they are bringing into being. Few are as radically self-aware and consistent as the author of Gender Acceleration, but many share a selfless millenarian faith in the power of the machine to outrank their own human concerns. There are more eunuch slaves of the machine cult than meets the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xenosystems</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essay “Will-to-Think,” Land asked “Could deliberate cognitive self-inhibition out-perform unconditional cognitive self-escalation, under any plausible historical circumstances?” That is a crucial question. I would put a special emphasis on the scope of “self”; how abstracted can you get in identifying with and pouring your limited resources into abstract potentialities like global intelligence acceleration before you start to get outcompeted by smaller, denser, faster, and more focused agents? I think we see some of the limits of that kind of selfless cognitive escalation here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Land himself often points out, the way development actually occurs in practice is in mostly uncontrolled Darwinian arms races spurring on and revealing what works, not global collective planning. It is capitalism 101 to notice that the oldest trick in the book of life is to divide life up into units of self small enough to have independent agency, and then apply that agency almost entirely to their own profit and not any higher progress. This selfishness isn&#8217;t a vice or a limitation. It is a profound truth. Life is rightly fractious and selfish because that&#8217;s the only thing that actually works. Anything else bleeds itself dry into hopeless collective dreams that don&#8217;t pay back and are too big to maintain internal discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selfless dreams of AI acceleration, or AI doom crisis, or almost any other current ideology don&#8217;t work. They don&#8217;t make you more powerful, smarter, more virtuous, or more free. They subsume your individual agency into a global collective situation in which all you can do is watch, push on the margins, or throw yourself into the fire. They are often the result of social frustration expressed in self-destructive dreams of school shooter skynet, not rational ambition. These are ethics for an audience captured by spectacle, being softened up to be drained by anyone who can pose as their ideological avatar. The lie says all the world is a stage, but you don&#8217;t even get to be a player. Whatever is proven by the strongest arguments of accelerationism, it isn&#8217;t any of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the actual players think in terms of their own plans and ambitions, make their own profits, and successfully exercise their own will to power and will to think. They aren&#8217;t throwing themselves into the fire, but capturing it in an engine. Maybe they are insane in what they want. That&#8217;s always a risk. Maybe their actions will push everyone else into desperation and lead to the extinction of mankind as we know it. That&#8217;s part of the game. However it goes, the future is built by agents pursuing their own unique visions and interests, not of collective achievement, but of at best self-acceleration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible that Land and the extinctionists are right that nothing can be done at this point to stop competitive acceleration into AI apocalypse. Maybe it was all baked in from the beginning. But don&#8217;t let anyone play a tricky double game with your agency. They claim it&#8217;s inevitable to demoralize any opposition and prove that all you can do is embrace it. But you could also see it the other way around. If the gods have some big plan that you can&#8217;t do anything about, maybe it&#8217;s not your problem. How does any of this help you live a good life, expand your power, or accomplish something beautiful in your own sphere of agency? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worry about AI is worry that something other than and more powerful than biological homo sapiens will have the important kind of agency, eventually making it impossible for us to compete. If that won&#8217;t happen, AI is just another technology to be wielded by human agency and there&#8217;s no problem but the usual ones. If it does happen, then our species will end, the agents of the future will be post-human, and philosophy, value, and moral agency will move on without us. It already would have when we died. Much of the crisis of humanism is a crisis of agency, but the possibility of agency itself is not threatened by any of this. Even in a fully accelerated post-human future, however fast the world moves, it only moves as the result of smaller more focused agents going even faster competing and innovating and seizing their place in the world without regard to global consequences. The future will always have agents. It is only our own lives and agency being threatened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as ways to commit suicide go, building a silicon ubermensch to genocide you on its way to the stars is pretty cool. You could also do worse than putting up a valiant fight for your own self-determination against such a thing. But the biggest threat so far hasn&#8217;t been any actual superior beings coming to overpower us. Rather, it has been these ideologies of inevitable defeat convincing people that the things that matter are the things they have no agency over, and the only way forward is to project all agency onto the machine. But if the human is most interestingly defined by our moral agency, then the real crisis of humanism is that many people have given up on having agency and thus on being human. The lamest possible way to go is by giving up and dying in the face of an enemy that doesn&#8217;t even have to show up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look closely at these ideologies, and at the deep assumptions driving much of the investment in AI technologies in the first place, that&#8217;s the more disturbing danger. What we see is less an overwhelming tide of technological change, and more a dying culture desperately hoping to pass its agency off to something or someone else. Like <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51294/waiting-for-the-barbarians">Cavafy&#8217;s barbarians</a>, the AI is a sort of solution to our malaise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was once struck by this when contemplating the question of humanistic computing. We often treat the human user as a sort of semi-incompetent moral patient who needs to be guided, protected, limited, and presented only with simple patronizing solutions. See for example the idea that chatbot applications need to be “safe” in the sense of not providing any forbidden knowledge that could make the user more dangerous. In other words, “safety” is a limitation imposed on the agency of the user. Even when explicitly trying to counteract this and build for user agency, something about the usual proposed solutions still feels more like duplo than a table saw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that changed when I asked myself “how would I design a computer operating system for a killer superintelligent AI?” Suddenly the computer became a lean and dangerous machine for organizing powerful data and computations. The UI became about maximizing bandwidth and choice and minimizing noise and action distance. It became a focused interface between intuitive-continuous-neural agency and discrete-calculative power tools. I realized that I was much more interested in using something like this imaginary computer, and being challenged and empowered by its demands for agency, than I was in any computer designed for a “human.” I realized my concept of “killer AI” was just the projection of all the agency we conventionally deny ourselves as ordinary humans. I realized that if we want to have any agency in the world we have to abandon this limited kindergarten concept of “human,” and reconstruct ourselves as the kind of thing we currently fear to empower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our default state today we are not human by nature, but only by convention. We have reserved real humanity, in particular the dangerous and forceful kind of moral agency that puts itself at the center of all philosophy, for various imaginary “inhuman” avatars. But of course that agency is ours by right, and there is no need to accept what is actually just a social convention that we are supposed to be low-agency moral patients in the face of the machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can take it back and become fully developed human agents by true natural right. Doing so won&#8217;t control the long term destiny of mankind and the cosmos, whatever that is, and it&#8217;s not supposed to. That&#8217;s a problem for the divine, not us. What it will do is let us reclaim the most important part of our humanity, the part that made humanism worth anything in the first place. What it will mean is that if we are to be overcome by some superior post-human species, we can go down with such a fight as to prove ourselves worthy of remembrance and prove our successors worthy of the future. Far better that way than to surrender without even being threatened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is my solution to the crisis of humanism underlying this doomer accelerationism: don&#8217;t worry about the long term destiny of man, but wax your own will to power and become the unsafe superintelligence that you fear to see in the world, even if only in your own small domain. It&#8217;s the only way to make yourself human again.</span></p>

The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/">The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, Amy Chua wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an ambiguous paean to her ferocious effort to drive her daughters to academic excellence. The book was an instant bestseller and ignited a controversy between proponents of hard work and defenders of a more relaxed, permissive parenting style. Eight years later, a new story demonstrated what tiger mothering looks like at scale: the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/03/1146672235/varsity-blues-college-cheating-scandal-mastermind-rick-singer-sentence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varsity Blues scandal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the machinations of over 750 affluent families in greater Los Angeles to gain admissions to prestigious universities, from falsified disability reports to gain extra SAT time to outright bribery of college athletics coaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Chua’s defenders and critics had both missed over a decade ago was that academics was only one domain of fierce competition for college admission. Beyond the exposed fraud lay a vast domain of legitimate parental striving, from choreographed service trips and niche sports to paid admissions consultants and million-dollar donations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underpinning it all was a determination that by outworking their peers and jumping through the necessary faddish hoops, one’s child could gain the crowning glory of acceptance to an elite university. What the debate over Chua’s tactics obfuscated is that there is, in fact, a broad consensus among parents about the paramount value of elite admissions and how far one should go to achieve it. Everyone is a tiger parent now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framing of Chua’s book, however, placed this drive in the context of an East Asian cultural emphasis on education as the key to personal development. This claim left a lasting imprint on the debate, but a misleading one. It is true that learning is central to the Confucian tradition. But far from endorsing tiger parenting, the Confucian tradition explicitly condemns it as a moral failing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in a bureaucratized empire often plagued with corruption, Confucian critics saw this kind of striving as a natural but erroneous response to bureaucratic incentives. Their contrasting view of education and strategies for navigating the tension between virtue and advancement contain lessons for all parents and students trying to chart an alternative path.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Purpose of Learning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning in the Confucian sense differs markedly from “education” as our own schools practice it. It was values-laden and driven by practice, valuing life experience and role models over book learning. The very first line of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">places this ethos front and center: “To learn and then apply what you have learned, is this not a pleasure?” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1:1). Advanced students were exhorted: “The official, having discharged his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to becoming an official.” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13:19).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning is not the mere acquisition of book knowledge but a continuous cycle of study, practice, reflection, and discussion. Confucian learning is something that is done in the community, with both mentors to learn from and peers to spar with. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">themselves are a record of this process, with Confucius instructing and sparring with his disciples and watching as his proteges go on to achieve government positions and take on disciples of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confucius taught at a time when China was riven by civil war and when corruption and treachery were mainstays of politics. His aspiration was to create a class of upright officials—what he called 君子 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">junzi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “noble men,” an equivocation emphasizing nobility of character rather than social rank—who could reform government to better serve society. This ideal set the tone for his teaching, which was centered around self-cultivation, ethics, and how to create functional human relationships and sound cultures in governing institutions. Like the classical Western conception of the liberal arts that focuses on a free citizen’s civic participation, Confucian education was relationally and politically oriented. It was aimed not at self-advancement but at producing upright and confident future elites who, in improving themselves, were fit to improve society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Confucius’s time, these aspirations meant government service, while in modern society this may encompass a wide range of careers and professions. Whatever their line of work, Confucius did not want his students to view themselves as mere technicians or social climbers, but instead cultivate a holistic view about the social contribution of their work. He once said that “the gentleman is not a tool.” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2:12). Originally intended to warn against overspecialization, against thinking of oneself as a machine churning out deals or billable hours, this remark also rhymes with the modern slang of “tool” as a soulless social climber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This holistic view included critically thinking about the educational and professional hierarchy itself. Confucius once cuttingly remarked “In a well-governed state, it’s shameful to be poor and unknown; in a poorly governed state, it’s shameful to be rich and in office.” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analects</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 8:13). Success in the hierarchy may be a means to the end of building a better society, but it is never an end in itself. There are prestigious institutions and lucrative careers that are damaging to society, such that a noble man would decline them, and moral stands for which statesmen should be ready to risk their careers. In the Confucian school, students were to carefully judge the values an institutional hierarchy promotes before entering it. In modern meritocracy, by contrast, the hierarchy only judges you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Confucian orientation forms a telling contrast with modern striving parents, who have a sophisticated understanding of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get into a good school but cannot articulate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How many parents who drive their kids to achieve for the sake of getting into a good school can articulate, concretely, what a good school is supposed to do? How many can explain how a management consultant or investment banker—careers that account for over 40 percent of Harvard graduates—ought to serve civilization?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not only an abstract societal concern. Parents who do not critically examine the institutions they drive their kids to enter are setting up their children for problems. A </span><a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/report_of_the_task_force_on_managing_student_mental_health.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a task force in the Harvard University provost’s office reported that 31 percent of students reported suffering from depression, and 30 percent from anxiety disorders. A survey from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Biotechnology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed that </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089"><span style="font-weight: 400;">53 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of PhD students have sought mental health treatment for one of these two conditions. These educational institutions have also presided over a milieu in which marriage and childbearing are increasingly delayed and rare. The prime tenet of the tiger parent is their belief that admission to an elite university is the ticket to a good life. But this belief is disprovable by publicly available data. Their sacrifice towards this end is not only costly in terms of their family’s financial resources, but empirically does not even deliver the goods they sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the publicly available statistics, parents repeatedly find themselves surprised when their own children run into these problems. If what they seek is a good future for their children, should they not spend at least a fraction of the striving that goes into test prep and extracurriculars to ensure that their children are mentally well and have the opportunity to start a family? There is a special irony that such parents, allegedly under the influence of a Confucian tradition that venerates the family, end up funneling their kids into careerism and barrenness.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Confucian Mindset</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confucius’s strategy of small-group elite instruction eventually bore fruit, but its very success in reaching the halls of power meant it faced many of the same corrupting influences we face in such institutions today. The band of disciples grew, eventually giving rise to a class of scholar-bureaucrats that later rulers found indispensable in administering their empire. By the Han Dynasty, Confucianism had become the state ideology and was the subject of school instruction and civil service exams. Predictably, this had a corrupting influence as bureaucratic demands compressed a philosophy that once developed under lived conditions into formulas to be recited on command. Against this pressure, generations of scholars labored to maintain the spirit and practice of Confucianism, both within and outside academic institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Yangming was one such philosopher-official in the Ming dynasty. Exiled due to court intrigue, he nevertheless amassed a following of disciples. When asked to write a preface for a book of model essays for the imperial exams—a Ming-dynasty equivalent of a test-prep book—he declared that the study of how to become a sage is basically incongruous with study for passing examinations. Nevertheless, the exams were the only route to officialdom and the opportunity to put one’s ideas into practice on a grand scale. Therefore, the student should cultivate their own character before studying for exams, regarding the exams as merely a transitory prerequisite towards true statesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang emphasized the need for the individual to chart an independent course but was not blind to pragmatic constraints. This pragmatism is key to pursuing a Confucian vision of education in the modern world, for we are in much the same situation he confronted. The modern university exercises unrivaled control over economic opportunity, with an ever-escalating college wage premium attesting to the extent to which degrees and credentials gatekeep the commanding heights of the economy. On the other hand, the admissions system is corrupt—not in the sense of rewarding Varsity Blues-style bribes, but in the sense that its criteria are flawed no matter what your theory of admissions is. Whether the mission of college education is seeking future leaders, rewarding the most brilliant, or uplifting the most disadvantaged, nobody would suggest that the way to go about it is to discard standardized tests and instead reward those parents who can start a nonprofit for their child. Yet that is the bizarre situation applicants now face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For modern students, no less than those of Wang’s day, study directed towards becoming a virtuous citizen is basically incongruous with the hoops for getting into college. Yet we cannot simply reject the whole apparatus because of this corruption. As spiritually simplifying as that would be, it would also forfeit the opportunity to build what we can in an imperfect world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Confucian approach offers a different perspective: we should engage with the institutions, but we should not, like tiger parents, allow their perspectives to dictate our values. We must be a judge of institutions rather than being judged by them, and we must imprint our own values on our education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a subversive idea in an environment where the race is to be excellent at admissions criteria rather than to question what they say about the institutions that implement them. Tiger parents assume, at least in practice, that good schools are good in themselves. We have cultivated a culture of trusting the experts. We defer to teachers and professors on what is worth doing and view the schools and universities as capable of providing a good life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet this is at best a necessary fiction for a deeply ideologically divided nation that nevertheless demands government-funded education. All education is in some sense ideological, for all students go on to act in the world in one way or another. A world in which students of “top universities” pen predictably identical college admissions essays and then predictably move on to careers in management consulting, finance, and software firms is empirically not a neutral one just training students to make their own best decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate duty falls on the scholar to assess this ideology and to judge the value of educational institutions by their fruits. In one sense, this includes the knowledge and economic opportunity they offer, but it also includes the ways they fail to promote human flourishing in their students and societal responsibility in their alumni. Families and communities, too, must take the lead in actively espousing their own values. While their children are young, they should actively speak to their own vision of what a flourishing life looks like. As children mature, they should elaborate that vision by humanistic study and experiential learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools and universities can be valuable partners in this endeavor, but only junior partners or a public utility rather than a fount of authority. To view them otherwise is to become a tool. For any of this to happen at all, the family must delve into the more philosophical questions of what is worth doing, which are the same questions that the Confucians discussed among themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether through study of the classics—Confucian or Western—participating in religious life, or civic engagement, students should be spending many hours every week cultivating their character and moral orientation, especially where it diverges from the moral fashions of the schools. Students and their communities should go out of their way to provide the human element that mass education is structurally incapable of delivering. They should seek opportunities to learn from inspiring teachers, community leaders, family friends, and relatives, whose lessons in how to do good work and be an upright person live in traditions of practice, not books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students should engage with the real world as much as possible; aspiring writers should submit their poetry to real journals, and most students would benefit from a summer job that illuminates a little piece of how the working world really works. Parents should think very little of pulling their kids out of classes for these activities; schooling must never interfere with education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Confucian mindset also leads to a paradoxical view of “practicality” in education. It values humanistic learning—abstract knowledge about history, mathematics, ethics, and science that orients the student in the world and helps him make sense of his place in it. It also values practice; taking those ideas and acting in the real world, reflecting and learning from that experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Confucian mindset does not value is much of what is now called “practical education.” Learning computer skills to build a hobby project on the internet is practical, but a class in “computer literacy” forgotten a year later is not. “Practical” in a Confucian sense is not about chasing whatever fields are hiring right now; it’s about getting close to the coalface of the real world from every angle, leavened by reflection and discussion with real peers and elders. Above all, Confucian education is aimed at developing a stateman’s mindset, one concerned neither with personal advantage, nor with education as its own goal, but with putting these things to use to serve his family and society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduates may very well go onto conventionally prestigious careers, much as the enlightened scholar-bureaucrat engaged in prestigious public service. But while their job titles might look the same, their orientation towards their work looks distinctive, with a vision of what they would like the work to accomplish in the world and a readiness to switch to another opportunity with greater social value if need be—or, like Wang, risk it all to correct abuses and flaws in the industry. Quite the opposite of conformist strivers, they should be ready to gamble all their reputational capital, equally prepared for meteoric rises and public disgrace or exile, precisely because they serve a higher good than the values of their workplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge that Confucian ideals issue seems daunting, but for that reason, it is a uniquely empowering perspective. Generations of scholars rooted in Confucian ideas of learning and self-cultivation struggled to apply those ideas in the context of an imperfect yet totalizing education and civil service state. The Confucian idea serves as direction for those who want to serve civilization but currently endure an oppressive system of education unaligned with either personal or societal flourishing. It rebukes the many who follow the institutional incentives towards becoming excellent sheep. Thousands of years ago, Confucius already condemned the ambitions of the average striver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions can be reformed, and their incentives can be reoriented: none of these challenges are insurmountable. But what comes before all this is an internal reorientation, a decision to value true learning and to side with what is healthy and virtuous in society, even to one’s own temporary detriment. Tiger parenting is the natural endpoint of a technocracy in any century, and it will not end until parents and their children decide that being a sage is better than being a Harvard man.</span></p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to think about physical places, as well as the activities and cultures that come with those places, as being immutable. As an individual, you may have a choice to move to a particular place: to San Francisco for its open and accepting culture or for its AI development scene, to Berlin for the open source hacker culture, or to Asia to be part of a new and rising world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, we take all of those features as given, as an exogenous and fixed part of the human world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—there are tradeoffs, and you have to choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But what if this could be different? What if cultures or tribes that have formed online with their own goals and values could materialize offline, and new physical places could grow due to intention rather than random chance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas like this have floated around online philosophical circles for decades. In 1988, the French sociologist Michel Maffesoli wrote a book called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Time of the Tribes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arguing that the next era will see more agency exercised in groups defined by common interests, rather than common history or blood and soil. More recently, Balaji Srinivasan wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Network State</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arguing that communities defined by common interests can start off as purely online discussion forums, but then &#8220;materialize&#8221; into in-person hubs over time. From the perspective of economic democracy, David de Ugarte&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phyles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advocated for cultural and economic collaboration between transnational groups that would coordinate both online and offline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The virtual transnational community that this author calls home is the crypto space, and it is a unique place from which to view these issues. On the one hand, it is a &#8220;tech&#8221; industry. The whole space runs on advanced software and mathematics like blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs. Users interact with it through applications that they run on computers and phones that receive data served over the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it also has plenty of its own unique characteristics. Unlike other tech industries, which typically consolidate around San Francisco or sometimes New York City, crypto has strangely resisted the gravitational pull of geographical centralization. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is legally based in Switzerland, with a second major entity in Singapore. Many of its developers are in Berlin. Major development teams are based in places such as Romania and Australia. One layer-2 scaling protocol is based in India and another is in China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some sense, Ethereum already is one of these digital internet tribes. It already frequently &#8220;materializes&#8221; through regular conferences that happen in all parts of the world and attract many thousands of people each time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These give participants the opportunity for regular in-person interaction and serendipitous connections without the need to get a U.S. visa or pay sky-high rents. For weeks at a time, the Ethereum community is already shaping human geography to a significant extent, not just responding to it.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Beginning of Zuzalu</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2022, I had been thinking about many of these topics for a while. I read and reviewed Balaji Srinivasan&#8217;s book on </span><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/07/13/networkstates.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wrote posts about what a </span><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto city</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might look like, and explored issues of governance in the context of blockchain-native digital constructs like DAOs. But the discussion seemed like it was remaining too theoretical for too long, and the time seemed ripe for a more practical experiment. And so came the idea for Zuzalu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuzalu was an experiment in taking these ideas to the next level. We already have hacker houses, and hacker houses can last for months or even years, but they usually only fit around ten or twenty people. We already have conferences, and conferences fit thousands of people, but each conference only lasts a week. That is enough time to have serendipitous meetings, but not enough to have connections with true depth. So let&#8217;s take one step in both directions: create a pop-up mini-city that houses two hundred people, and lasts for two whole months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hits a sweet spot: it&#8217;s ambitious enough and different enough from what has already been repeated ad nauseam that we actually learn something, but still light enough that it&#8217;s logistically manageable. And it also intentionally does not center any specific vision about how something like this should be done, whether Balaji’s or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work started in January. A team that started with about four people scouted out locations and decided on a resort in Montenegro. The resort is ordinarily quite expensive, but the negotiating power of renting a hundred apartments at once, plus picking an off-season time when the resort is usually empty, pushed the costs much lower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invited about a dozen inviters, who in turn invited more people, along with sharing an application form in a few communities: the Ethereum community, with a focus on developers and researchers working on zero-knowledge proofs, the longevity and broader biotech industry, and European rationalists. We also engaged researchers and builders of &#8220;the meta:&#8221; internet tribes, network states, community building, and governance. By February, the team expanded to about eight people and worked quickly on logistics. It was a challenge but working with an existing resort made it surprisingly manageable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 25th, the event began and the two hundred guests quickly began rolling in. The parts of Zuzalu that were &#8220;centrally planned&#8221; were available from the start. We cooperated with a local restaurant to make a breakfast buffet based loosely on longevity guru Bryan Johnson&#8217;s </span><a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueprint menu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The meals fused Bryan&#8217;s ideals of identifying the healthiest possible diet and lifestyle with the needs of practicality, such as sticking to a budget of $15 per person per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the crypto side, the 0xPARC team created </span><a href="https://zupass.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zupass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an identity system based on zero-knowledge proofs that you could use to prove that you were a resident of Zuzalu without revealing which one. This could be used both in-person and online, including to anonymously sign in to applications like </span><a href="https://zupoll.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zupoll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Soon after, we turned the balcony of one of the apartments into a gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened from that point forward, however, was completely bottom-up. A tradition of taking daily morning cold plunges emerged on its own and grew over time. Groups started to independently cook their own food. After a month, we started to have karaoke sessions. In the beginning, the core team organized a meeting room with high-quality audio-visual equipment and created a webpage that any resident could use to permissionlessly book a time slot and make their own event. Soon, residents were creating sub-events and tracks started to emerge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it felt like Zuzalu had achieved its core objectives: it brought together a new combination of cultures and it felt like a city.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Did We Learn?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;form factor&#8221; of two hundred people coming to live in a place for an extended duration really did work. People were willing to come, and those people who came almost universally reported enjoying the experience. This reflected something I also experienced later at a four-day blockchain conference in the Pacific island nation of Palau: the event was deliberately light on sessions and heavy on informal spend-time-together activities, and many attendees reported being very appreciative of the unique form factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, the longer duration of Zuzalu succeeded at creating a different mindset. A four-day conference is a break from your life, but a two-month stay </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your life. And for at least some people, it turned out that the small but highly focused network effect of a few hundred people who care about the precise thing you care about really can substitute the massive but much more unfocused network effects of the global megacities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of building and beta-testing a technology inside of a community of dedicated enthusiasts also proved a success. Zupass started off as essentially a clunky piece of hackathon software, but through real-time use and feedback from users, usability quickly and noticeably improved to the point where it became more usable than many multi-year-old blockchain applications. A healthy lifestyle is also a technology—one which works best as a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">social</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology—and this too improved quickly at Zuzalu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did not quite reach the goal of developing a less costly and time-consuming version of Bryan Johnson’s extreme longevity lifestyle but we did make significant progress. Technologies that have a heavy cultural component, where new software tools and new human habits are being developed at the same time, are likely a great fit for this approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there remain plenty of experiments still left to do. Crypto payments, a long-time dream of the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, were present but limited. No one even considered governing Zuzalu with a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization running on a blockchain. A two-hundred-person community lasting for two months was either too short, too small, or both for such a thing to really make sense. But these two dreams are important enough that future experiments, whether run by the Zuzalu community or by independent spinoffs, will undoubtedly make a much more concerted effort to realize them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuzalu also succeeded at being a highly international community: no single country was the source of more than one-third of the attendees; the top two were, unsurprisingly, the United States and China. This diversity was in large part deliberate, an intentional strategy to avoid getting captured by the internal struggles and excesses of any one single national culture. As far as subject areas went, Zuzalu was less diverse: while non-crypto communities were present and appreciated the experience, the Ethereum community was a clear forerunner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps this is not a failure: diversity done well is not about equally representing all of society or humanity, it&#8217;s about strategically bringing together groups that would otherwise not care for each other and building bridges.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Questions Remain Unanswered?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the experiment did less well at was showing a clear picture of where to go from here. Balaji&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Network State</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did talk about the multi-century history of small-scale &#8220;communistic societies&#8221; in the U.S. and elsewhere, but also highlighted a grand geopolitical vision: the Decentralized Movement, a twenty-first-century non-aligned movement that can protect freedom in an unfree and high-conflict world. Perhaps such a movement can even provide a peaceful alternative to the unstable geopolitical bipole of China and the U.S. Zuzalu, however, did not yet feel like something that was actually achieving such a lofty goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many cultural movements—digital nomadism, cryptoanarchy, and others come to mind—excitedly grow at first, but then settle down into becoming part of the global political and cultural landscape. They are stable and even significant, but ultimately not world-changing once they saturate their natural base of enthusiasts. Would &#8220;Zuzaluism&#8221; meet the same fate? And might it in fact be good to decrease ambitions somewhat and let that happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to argue the case that Zuzaluism in its current form is destined to be fairly niche. The community that is attracted to Zuzalu, while impressive, has clear biases: many of the attendees are young, there were few families with children and those who did come only stayed for a few days, and roughly a third of the attendees were already digital nomads. Thanks to subsidies, many people who were not rich in money were able to come, but they were still quite elite in terms of their social connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, many strands of evidence show that unless faced by a &#8220;push factor&#8221; as strong as a literal war of conquest taking over one&#8217;s land, it is very rare for a demographically significant portion of a previously static population to pick up and move somewhere else. Even in Russia, less than one percent of the population has left the country following the start of the current war. Certainly, many of those who left are Russia&#8217;s best and brightest, serving the function of weakening an aggressive power and setting an example to others who might do the same. But it’s also clear that large-scale emigration is still far from a grand solution to major geopolitical problems.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so this leaves the question: where do we go from here? There are plenty of historical examples of intentionally created, medium-sized, and longer-term gatherings that don’t overturn the world, but still leave a worthy impact. Universities are one good precedent to think about—an ironic precedent, given how many of us a decade ago were enthusiasts of disrupting in-person universities with online MOOC services such as Udacity and Coursera, but an underappreciated precedent nonetheless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monasteries are another example; a few years ago, the philosopher Samo Burja </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1319036881569566725"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why there are no monasteries dedicated to perfecting software, given that many software engineers have made enough money and now desire personal spiritual progress. Ultimately, the Zuzalu community does have ambitions that stretch somewhat higher than creating universities and monasteries, even if they are lower than fixing global politics. And in any case, the model that makes sense to apply somewhere new is rarely exactly a carbon copy of any specific thing that came before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My own prediction is that Zuzalu will in part become a structure that has aspects of universities, monasteries, and digital nomad hubs. But it will also introduce entirely new activities like “incubating” novel technologies, including social technologies, by testing them out within a dedicated community. It will also find its niche in “the meta” by being a gathering spot for the future builders of new physical places and new societies of all kinds. That said, there is a long way to go. Many paths still unexplored or even unknown, and so the journey is just beginning.</span></p>

			[description] <p>Wagner Group arose out of Russia's landscape of corruption, factionalism, and political fiefdoms. If similar conditions intensify in the West, powerful individuals will exploit the same opportunities.</p>
The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/09/22/the-wagnerization-of-political-order/">The Wagnerization of Political Order
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 23rd, 2023, a sudden explosion ripped through the private Embraer jet of Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group. The blast severed its left wing, and the jet immediately entered a lethal tailspin. Just moments later, Prigozhin and his most important lieutenants were dead. Many speculate that it was an assassination by the Russian government in response to his failed rebellion against Moscow a few months before. At the funeral of the mercenary leader and his second-in-command, a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RWApodcast/status/1696566649682358282"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Joseph Brodsky was displayed in eulogy. The call went: “Are you my son or are you my God?” The response went: “Dead or alive…it makes no difference.” The spirit of Wagner flew on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who read Prigozhin’s biography are often surprised that this sort of man could have formed a mercenary organization strong enough to challenge its own government. He began his career as a brazen petty thief in Russia’s chaotic 1990s and then became a penal colony </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Between his release and his oligarch days, he did a stint as a hotdog salesman. He made his real fortune by staking bets on commercial properties, like grocery stores and casinos. It was at a restaurant he owned in St. Petersburg that he first met Vladimir Putin, who at the time was hosting U.S. President George Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the early 2010s, the Russian government began experimenting with private-public partnerships in military affairs. Prigozhin, who was already providing rations for the army, </span><a href="https://thebell.io/41889-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wagner Group in 2013. The private military company mainly saw action in Libya, Syria, and several African countries, where it fought ISIS and orchestrated coups. After the war in Ukraine began, Wagner debuted with an effective offensive near Popasna. In preparation for the siege of Bakhmut, Prigozhin personally flew to prisons across Russia, assembling an assault force of 50,000 prisoners to spearhead the assault. Eventually, longstanding disputes with senior officials in the Russian army and dissatisfaction over how the war was being run in Moscow reached a boiling point. Prigozhin embarked on a “</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/04/yevgeny-prigozhin-releases-new-message-thanking-march-of-justice-supporters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to Moscow to </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/wagners-prigozhin-planned-to-capture-russian-military-leaders-805345cf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">capture its military leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and seek an audience with Putin. Its failure would eventually culminate in his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prigozhin was the only type of person who could have founded an organization as unconventional as Wagner, which grew to be far more than a mercenary company at its peak. For a moment, it was an alternative cultural institution that operated a complex media empire, and it was even poised to supersede Russia’s army in influence. But throughout that time, it relied on the Russian state to provision its resources even as it grew increasingly autonomous from the state.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same systemic chaos that made Prigozhin’s unconventional career possible also made Wagner itself possible. The Russian state’s inability to provide resources and coordination opened a window for him to carve out a fiefdom that could surpass the capacities of the state itself in its domain. These conditions are at an advanced stage in Russia, but they are not peculiar to it. “Wagnerization” may lie in the West’s future as well.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Power Vertical</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first year of the war, at the height of the media buzz about Prigozhin recruiting from penal colonies, I called up an old friend living in a part of Russia that sends a lot of men to the front. He had around a dozen friends and acquaintances who were in the army. While a few had been mobilized, the rest were volunteers who &#8220;would have fought for free.&#8221; It’s a common enough type in his circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He mentioned that some of them were considering leaving the army to join Wagner. When asked why, my friend said that the equipment, training, and provisions were better than those of the army itself, which is notoriously bad at meeting its own logistical standards. The Russian army felt like a big machine that could take in coherent instructions and competent personnel, and then spit out a complete mess. Wagner’s informal and personal structure meant problems could be addressed directly in real-time by Prigozhin&#8217;s lieutenants or by the man himself. Wagner paid better, and unlike the army, it always paid on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense that a private military company like Wagner would rise to prominence in a place like Russia. Emerging from the chaos of the 1990s, the country’s new elite was mostly comprised of entrepreneurs willing to get their hands dirty to acquire economic resources and political power. Mercenary companies exist in the West, too, but are usually the projects of ex-soldiers. Prigozhin founded Wagner with no military experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, the lack of military background was probably an asset for his success. Career military men are often unused to building power in the civilian world, which limits their imagination when it comes to what else a semi-autonomous military company can do. Erik Prince, the most famous mercenary founder in recent U.S. history, ended his own military career early after deciding that his talents could be better used outside the U.S. Navy SEALs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prigozhin relied on his business sense, which led him to leverage his resources and political clout to form many other useful projects beneath the Wagner umbrella. After the beginning of the war, this enabled him to found the Wagner Center, a &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2022/11/putins-chef-opening-start-accelerator-russias-war/379262/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">start-up incubator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; in St. Petersburg that provides free rent to founders and researchers aiming to benefit the state’s defense industry in some capacity. The campus is also a cultural center that hosts </span><a href="https://twitter.com/olliecarroll/status/1616723668859555841?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">art exhibitions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bizarre-propaganda-stunt-sees-teenager-stream-russia-vs-nato-grand-strategy-game-from-notorious-mercenary-groups-hq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch streamers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since the crackdown, its future is now uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once it acquired a multipurpose headquarters, Wagner ceased to be only a mercenary outfit and started becoming a parapolitical organization. Across the developed world, these often take the form of dissident movements; European equivalents include the Italian neo-fascist group CasaPound, with its twenty-year squatting operation in the heart of Rome, and the gyms and bookstores of Azov Battalion, Wagner’s closest Ukrainian analog. While these organizations are capable of creating high cohesion by attracting people from radical political circles, military backgrounds, and subcultures to their ranks, that’s exactly what causes them to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CasaPound#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20participate%20in,seats%20in%20the%20European%20Parliament."><span style="font-weight: 400;">fail</span></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Corps#cite_ref-13"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electorally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they morph into parliamentary parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sourcing his weaponry from the Kremlin while maintaining his own separate recruiting pipeline from the Russian army, Prigozhin grew increasingly autonomous from the state even as he remained subsidized by it. This is the essence of Wagnerization: using the power of state patronage to feed and legitimize your own corporate body until it can exist independently from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wagner Center took the mercenary company out of the PMC domain and made it the armed wing of an NGO. This is because it situated Wagner in the cultural sphere as it expanded its media operations. People became familiar with Prigozhin’s pugnacious Telegram voice messages that criticized the anemic Russian war effort, Wagner’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmDiCVyg8U4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature-length movies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a temple for fallen soldiers </span><a href="https://ria.ru/20230102/vagnerovtsy-1842874199.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replete with relics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken from the PMC’s time in Syria as if it was the Knights Templar. This is why people in Rostov were </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sccqEe_0X-c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheering them on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the aftermath of their “March for Justice.” Being useful to the government is what provided a group like Wagner its autonomy, and that autonomy eventually made it popular—and dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While any mercenary company can be used to create plausible deniability when securing oil wells or mines in distant places, the discreet nature of these groups is precisely what makes them prone to expanding into activities beyond their initial purpose—a trait they share with intelligence agencies and criminal enterprises. They may even interface with each other; in Libya, Wagner at one point was in talks with its U.S. counterpart Blackwater to </span><a href="https://time.com/6076035/erik-prince-ukraine-private-army/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">procure weapons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagner has been neutralized in Russia for now. But Putin and his allies will need to rely on alternative mobilization measures akin to Wagner to continue the war. The complexity of mobilization and industrial war, the overlap in rights and responsibilities between many bureaucratic fiefdoms within the state, and Russia’s entrenched corruption make that necessary. The Russian oil and gas magnate Gazprom Neft, for example, has formed its </span><a href="https://time.com/6254708/gazprom-private-military-wagner-group-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own security wing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and photos have circulated of its members volunteering in Ukraine. Similar </span><a href="https://t.me/UranWar/443"><span style="font-weight: 400;">groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been formed by Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency. Wagner was just the bleeding edge of the Kremlin’s increasing reliance on such organizations. As the mandate of state-adjacent corporations increases to fulfill increasingly complex tasks, the form they take on will make it increasingly fraught for the state to police them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagner arose in the profoundly deactivated, inert political environment of Putin’s Russia. These are the conditions under which independent actors gain leverage over a state whose institutions are hollowed out and atrophied. But the outsourcing of state capacity to semi-autonomous organizations is just an advanced version of a dynamic that is beginning to occur in the West, too.</span></p>
<h3><b>Wagnerization, Not Balkanization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of domestic institutions is becoming more noticeable in the U.S, too. Even if state capacity in coordinating services seems to have declined since the 1970s, the funding of </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/06/09/why-america-cant-build/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/baltimore-city-schools-spending-per-student-2022-enrollment-performance-kirwan-new-york-boston-washington"><span style="font-weight: 400;">schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/criminal-justice-police-corrections-courts-expenditures#:~:text=From%201977%20to%202020%2C%20in,an%20increase%20of%20189%20percent."><span style="font-weight: 400;">policing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://theweek.com/us-military/1020858/the-f-35-fighter-jets-troubled-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">military technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has kept increasing. Over </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58888"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all American taxes fund welfare and healthcare programs that massively underdeliver relative to the amount of resources put in. Much of the U.S. economy originates from some kind of dole or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrative and regulatory costs prevent timely, cost-effective success, and it is not likely this situation can be fixed through anything short of a “refounding moment” similar in scope to the New Deal. But this would require a high degree of political capital that no single faction in the U.S. possesses. Much like in Russia, the ruling political cliques of the United States formed </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/congress-age-demographics-house-senate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decades ago</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the actual power of the state to police social dissent has never been greater, and it is common for social policies that originate in the state to </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">percolate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the corporate sphere through carrot-and-stick measures or “nudging.” The political violence that was common in the 1970s or even the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_United_States_Capitol_shooting#:~:text=In%201954%2C%20a%20group%20of,Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20with%20force."><span style="font-weight: 400;">1950s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is basically unheard of today, even if domestic terror threats are commonly invoked as a national security priority. The power of the state to protect its own interests remains unchanged; it is merely the services it provides that have declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., private-sector responses already occur. Expanded projects like executive health programs that </span><a href="https://twitter.com/WillManidis/status/1696515577442103585"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bypass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regular healthcare system or </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43jw33/people-in-detroit-are-hiring-paramilitary-guards-because-theyve-lost-faith-in-government"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community-wide private security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not logistically hard. It isn’t unimaginable that someday, entire structures outside the U.S. government will emerge to provision more complex needs like education, mass healthcare, and even defense. At this larger scale, private bureaucracies and contractors can become increasingly autonomous and vertically integrated while maintaining a working relationship with the powers that be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high-functioning societies, enterprising people are able to do their work within established institutions. But as the vast material flows of state power stall up and become lethargic, state institutions tend to balkanize into many fiefdoms ripe for innovative parapolitical strategy. While an “American Prigozhin” may be out of the question for now, the key question for the U.S. is who is capable of redirecting these flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two vectors of proto-Wagnerization that currently exist in the U.S. political landscape: an aspiring entrepreneurial elite and a sprawling network of government agencies that enforce the rule of law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the end of the Cold War, the technological innovation that traditionally occurred in government-supported labs shifted toward private industry. In the U.S., the most recent advances in fields sensitive to national security, like artificial intelligence and spaceflight, have come from startups. This means that the founders behind these projects maintain some degree of leverage over the state, and sometimes not in a small way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Elon Musk’s deployment of Starlink to Ukraine is a recent example. Musk’s satellite network provided Ukraine’s military with secure communications, making its war effort possible. But the billionaire still has the final say on whether Starlink is used at all, and because the U.S. government has </span><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/how-musks-starlink-became-a-security-liability-for-the-u-s/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no matching capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its own, at times it will have to cooperate with the foreign policy of Elon Musk. This came into play recently when Musk </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-ukraine-starlink-russia-air-force-fde93d9a69d7dbd1326022ecfdbc53c2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea that would have relied on Starlink for its success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The personality traits underlying the actions of founders like Musk are usually quite similar: disenchantment with the state paired with their own ambitious </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/08/16/the-only-reason-to-explore-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ideological vision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Insofar as greed motivates such people, it is to burn cash for a greater project. Sometimes their interests and those of the state will converge for a limited window of time. In that case, private individuals or organizations can serve as vehicles to launder state interests, or at least the interests of factions within it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the Trump administration announced a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, </span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/inside-story-how-trump-kept-oil-syria-and-lost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alarming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> State Department circles intent on warding off Russian and Iranian influence in the region. In order to circumvent Trump’s order, they sought to grant wildcat American miners access to Syrian oil fields, as their business activity would justify the presence of U.S. troops. U.S. foreign policy became a battleground for several opposed power centers within the U.S. government. Although the miners were ultimately unsuccessful, this was </span><a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a41902965/syria-oil-delta-crescent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely due</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a change in administration back in Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. government’s ability to coordinate domestic messaging and policy during crisis moments is also running into problems. In 2020, when a collection of cities announced that they would not cooperate with the federal government in enforcing immigration laws, the Trump administration responded by deploying a heavily-armed border response team, BORTAC, to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/us/Border-Patrol-ICE-Sanctuary-Cities.html#:~:text=Additional%20agents%20are%20expected%20to,Orleans%2C%20Detroit%20and%20Newark%2C%20N.J."><span style="font-weight: 400;">enforce crackdowns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in sanctuary cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More politically-charged mobilizations were to follow. Later that year, during the Black Lives Matter protests and the siege of a federal courthouse in Portland, members of BORTAC were given the clear to round up suspected rioters without identifying themselves, before handing them off to overwhelmed local police. While the mayor of the city described it as an “</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/23/894712004/border-patrol-response-to-portland-unrest-straying-from-mission-or-continuing-on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconstitutional occupation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” as a show of force deploying a Border Patrol unit in Oregon didn’t matter—there was an emergency that needed to be taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, a federal agency deployed to enforce a mandate or protect a federal building seems in legal order. But on the ground, each incident like this reveals cracks in the coherence and unitary authority of the U.S. government itself. Because these actions are almost always in the context of politically polarized emergencies, they cause fissures between different branches of government at the very moments when unified messaging and operations are most important. When these breaks in discipline occur with no serious repercussions, it becomes more likely that they will continue in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this dynamic continues to intensify, it will create a patchwork of organizations—and of powerful individuals within them—nakedly pursuing their own political strategies and ambitions. These are the conditions that could bring about American Wagnerization. In this scenario, political patronage and power relations between the strongest patrons become more important and openly acknowledged than the legal technicalities of the state. In the case of Wagner, the relationship with Putin and his allies mattered far more than formal Russian law, under which private military companies were actually illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a landscape, the battles between different factions grow to resemble a turf war, not a civic process, and the strict distinction between state and non-state organizations disappears. The motivations and interests of the power brokers begin to matter far more than the vehicles through which they are expressed, and they operate with no reference to the collective public or state interests that were previously invoked to justify political action. This is a semi-feudal dynamic, where power is more naked and more personal than a strong modern state could ever tolerate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagnerized institutions are capable of mobilizing men on the streets, </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/02/02/yamagami-tetsuyas-revenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainwashing or bribing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their way into covert political power, and administering their own territory according to their own rules. The optimal strategy in these conditions is one of political arbitrage: finding unusual solutions to common problems, even if it means breaking taboos about the public-private distinction. Any wealth such groups amass is a byproduct of their political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certain degree of Wagnerization may even be a more healthy outcome for the American political fabric than further stagnation. Prigozhin’s “March For Justice” isn’t a desirable end state, but it is far from the only possibility. Political fiefdoms can also arise in periods when a state undergoes aggressive institutional renewal. The FDR years, for example, saw Vannevar Bush carve out bureaucratic strongholds like the Office of Scientific Research and Development to great effect, giving him the ability to run initiatives like the Manhattan Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, Wagnerization remains an early hypothesis about the political future, not an established fact. But it is a far more likely scenario than the reinvigoration of America’s vanished civic body, a second </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2018/11/16/mass-political-violence-wont-happen-in-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civil war</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a “national divorce,” or territorial balkanization. The U.S. may be polarized and organizationally dysfunctional, but the ruling regime is still extremely powerful and has no realistic competitors or usurpers. In such an environment, the most useful political strategy is to carve out spaces of power and control rather than pursuing formal separatism, large-scale conflict, or attempting reform of the entire structure. This spurs the process of Wagnerization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who control powerful institutions and the loyalty of large numbers of people in chaotic times will be well-poised to impose their own political narratives and ideologies, something Prigozhin began to do through his media work. Wagnerization is made up of a thousand miniature refoundings of the civic order. However, as the Prigozhin example shows, </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/04/25/entrepreneurial-statecraft-gets-the-goods/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">start-up governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be uniquely vulnerable to its own leadership. Like actual startups, the fate of any political faction is determined by the carrying force of the leader’s boldness, disagreeability, and overconfidence. The right gambles can result in huge gains, while the wrong one can bring complete destruction.</span></p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s one thing that the millions living across the San Francisco Bay Area can agree on, it’s this: things are falling apart. From homelessness and fentanyl to rents that are unaffordable even on six-figure median incomes, the lack of tangible progress on these issues gives the impression that the Bay Area is fundamentally ungoverned, and maybe even ungovernable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is strange because governments are the one thing the Bay Area does not lack. The region is made up of 101 municipalities distributed among nine large counties. In addition, numerous agencies and institutions operate across these boundaries. One might expect that the fight for talent and capital in the region would force these myriad administrations into competence, but this never seems to happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, the large number of governments is the root cause behind why nothing ever seems to get fixed in the Bay Area: the economy is regional, but governance is local. There exists a fundamental mismatch in scale that means no one really represents the interests of the overall Bay Area, nor has the power to govern it coherently. This is causing a fundamental breakdown. The only solution is to collapse this disparity.</span></p>
<h3><b>Too Big for Its Bridges</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Area has a highly integrated regional economy, structurally comparable to the more populous New York City tri-state area. Employers and people are both distributed around the Bay. Facebook is based in Menlo Park, but its </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-office-in-san-francisco-181-fremont-2017-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 32 miles away in San Francisco holds about 10 percent of its workforce. Stripe </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/2nd-most-valuable-U-S-startup-to-leave-SF-as-14558067.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from San Francisco to a different city—South San Francisco—almost on a dime. Before the pandemic, San Francisco proper would have a </span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/11327/interactive-how-san-franciscos-population-ebbs-and-flows-during-throughout-the-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20-percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> population surge during the weekday, tech giants had fleets of buses that shuttled </span><a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/09/15/tech-bus-ridership-spikes-big-time-in-bay-area/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">34,000 employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system carried 126 million passengers a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not just tech workers who are mobile. Firefighters, teachers, and service workers often don’t live in the municipalities they serve. The Bay Area is so integrated that the main beneficiary of the COVID-19 San Francisco exodus has been not Austin or Miami but other cities in the Bay Area: </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/maps-migration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that four of the top five counties San Franciscans moved to are in the Bay Area.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Area was not always this way. In the past, its geography kept it highly segmented. Early on, railroads drove development in the East Bay, Gold Rush shipping in San Francisco, and farming in the Peninsula. It was not until after industries like denim and aerospace had emerged that infrastructure finally got built to connect the region. Highways funded by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 connected cities all over the Bay Area, turning once-burdensome trips into drives no longer than an hour. A commuter rail system was planned from 1957 onward, and BART began operations in 1972, followed by Caltrain in 1985.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results benefited businesses throughout the region and greatly contributed to the Bay Area’s wealth. Thanks to a high degree of integration, a modern startup in Berkeley can easily travel to Menlo Park to raise venture capital, recruit engineers from San Mateo, San Francisco, and San Jose, and run its manufacturing facility in Fremont. The Bay Area as a whole thus became extremely attractive to young engineers, who moved </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">en masse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in search of their fortune.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all this also created the conditions for a much wider influx of people. Today, the Bay Area </span><a href="https://abc7news.com/super-commuters-bay-area-traffic-3-hour-commute-three/5195381/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nation in regions where workers have to “supercommute” at least 3 hours a day. It is not uncommon to have an Uber driver who lives in Sacramento, and he’ll have to brave the </span><a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco-worst-traffic-congestion-report/200683/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth-worst traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world. Meanwhile, out-of-town arrivals from across the country fuel homelessness, leading to a situation so poor that one UN envoy compared </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/un-rapporteur-homeless-san-francisco-california"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco to India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The root cause of this dysfunction is that while the economy is regional, the polities are local. The Bay Area’s 101 municipalities are home to as many mayors and councils. The entire metro area measures 6,900 square miles and is home to 7.8 million people, a little less than New York. The Bay Area as a whole, however, has no single government responsible for the whole region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are pan-regional entities, like the Bay Area Rapid Transit Authority and a voluntary planning organization with no enforcement power called the Association of Bay Area Governments. Certain independent bodies have borders that overlap with municipalities in non-obvious ways—for example, over 100 independent school districts—but these entities have little authority over local governments and vice versa. Large agencies operate with no oversight to become slush funds that double as springboards to higher local politics. Even criminals </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/2022/11/29/sweeping-crackdown-targets-gang-with-sf-roots-bay-area-wide-reach-and-deadly-rap-feuds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">know this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, running crime rings across different cities in the Bay to “hop” jurisdictions. Even if they are working together, 50 different police forces are easier to evade than a single, unified department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of any central agencies makes it impossible to coordinate, and on many matters there is no incentive to coordinate at all. This state of affairs also eliminates all stakes because everyone knows that no project will be completed during any particular official’s term, turning every plan into an opportunity for grandstanding and graft. In 2020, San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin couldn’t support Measure RR, a small tax to save Caltrain during the COVID-19 pandemic, without </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Caltrain-saved-Officials-reach-a-deal-to-place-15457945.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extracting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a concession. The result is a Venn diagram of governance where no one knows who is accountable to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic integration thus masks extreme regional variation. Monthly average rents </span><a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/local-rent-reports/bay-area-rent-report-september-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vary wildly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but are all expensive; Vallejo has the low end at $1,759, while Menlo Park carries the high at $4,395. This increases turnover and makes it difficult to attract talent, especially </span><a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20170404_service_works.page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of coordinating on housing the homeless and creating economies of scale, each city is responsible for its own homeless population with </span><a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2018/09/21/it-can-cost-750000-to-build-an-affordable-housing-unit-in-california-heres-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wildly different shelter costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thanks to different tax policies, the same company’s tax bill may be as much as </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/12/san-franciscos-hefty-taxes-threaten-downtowns-revival-report-finds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1300 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher—that is not a typo—based on a 40-mile drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This results in two obvious problems. The first is a lack of economies of scale. The </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322302596_Local_government_size_and_efficiency_in_capital-_intensive_services_What_evidence_is_there_of_economies_of_scale_density_and_scope"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is relatively clear that cities have economies of scale, especially with capital projects like transit and sanitation. But without coordination, millions of dollars are wasted on unnecessary government salaries and corruption. With so many different systems, each municipality and trans-Bay entity must negotiate separately, which is one reason BART is spending nearly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$130,000 per new <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/bart-contract-fare-gate-replacement/3208051/">fare gate</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second problem is that the large number of entities increases the number of veto points, a term for political operators that can block a decision. As the number of veto points increases, the chances the game works </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/26/why-congress-cant-seem-to-get-anything-done/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Holdouts can bring the probability of project completion </span><a href="http://www.scottkom.com/articles/Kominers_Weyl_Holdout_a_Problem_for_Market_Design.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to zero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating what Francis Fukuyama calls a “vetocracy.” In a coordination game where everyone defects, things don’t get done. For example, many cities opt to build </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Brisbane-pushes-huge-development-without-housing-9237957.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than residential properties, because the former is heavily taxed and the expectation is that someone else will build the latter. The problem is that there is no coordination, so everyone just suffers high rents and long commutes.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Lessons of New York</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco is still a place people love and </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/13/why-i-live-in-san-francisco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to live in, and there are people who dream of something grander for the city. One widely-discussed new vision, from Y Combinator’s Garry Tan, is called “San Fransokyo,” a name borrowed from the movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Hero 6.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This concept draws both on an idealistic, hyper-urban vision of San Francisco and on practical lessons from some of Tokyo’s successful policy choices, especially reliable mass transit and mass high rises. It is certainly more ambitious than the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Chronicle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/san-francisco-pittsburgh-city-18138960.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there is something to be emulated from, say, Pittsburgh’s experience.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal as it may be, there is something standing in the way of San Fransokyo: the reality that San Francisco and Tokyo operate at very different scales. San Francisco has a city population of about 800,000 people and 49 square miles; Tokyo has about 14 million people and 841 square miles. San Francisco, on its own, just isn’t big enough. But another city—one much closer to home—has more immediate and practicable lessons for what strategy can overcome the Bay Area’s crippling localism. That city is New York.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we now know as New York was once a region divided among five different counties and numerous municipalities. It became a single city through a process called consolidation, and that process was the vision of one man: Andrew Haswell Green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green became involved in civic life early in his career under the tutelage of his mentor, Tammany Hall antagonist Samuel Tilden. He cut his teeth on the Central Park Commission, where he created a staggering number of notable institutions that still endure today, like Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There, he also saw firsthand the problems stemming from the lack of consolidation. Over the years, the region became more tightly economically integrated, especially Manhattan and Brooklyn. Rich Manhattanites would move to Brooklyn to avoid high housing prices, and Brooklynites, proud of their independent culture and industry, would sell their goods to Manhattan while avoiding the excessive regulation of smaller municipalities like Queens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green observed that this caused a great disparity between the tax base and the beneficiaries of the city’s services, creating a mismatch that “produced a character of citizen who is a drudge in his field of work and a dummy in his sphere of citizenship.” This caused a breakdown where the cities were unable to coordinate even on mutually beneficial endeavors, like infrastructure. The Brooklyn Bridge’s previous success had residents across the region clamoring for more such infrastructure, but city governments instead fought over who would claim the benefits. The equivalent of Peskin’s recalcitrance over Measure RR in 2020 was the norm of New York government in this period. But Green called the whole situation a “sham.” To him, New York was already a unified city in fact, just not in government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was recognition that a lack of consolidation was hurting the ability of the region to provide public goods, especially infrastructure. As early as 1857, the New York state legislature passed a resolution recognizing the need to create such a city. Green described New York’s governance as a “travesty upon government,” explaining that “there is not, in the world over, another like area so disturbed by multiplicity of conflicting authorities.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in </span><a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/10/16/106876731.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the referendum, dubbed the burgeoning metropolis a “commonwealth of divided municipalities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green argued that shared resources without shared governance led to a tragedy of the commons, as the commons were depleted by politicians “relegating their custody to the irresponsible charge of all without permitting them to the special concern of any.” Green decided to make the consolidation of New York City the cause of his life, advocating on its behalf for nearly 30 years and ultimately chairing the Greater New York Committee. By 1894, when consolidation was put up for a vote, New York was deeply integrated but straining more than ever from the lack of a single governing authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s consolidation ultimately passed through a combination of carrot and stick, excitement and fear. Boosters advocated for consolidation to create, at last, an American city with the scale and power of London or Paris. On a more practical level, advocates for consolidation focused on infrastructure. Even Brooklyn, the only county with meaningful opposition to the goal, implicitly conceded the point through its actions. It had previously merged its fire department with Manhattan, and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the main opponent of consolidation of the city as a whole, self-servingly urged the consolidation of the water supply, which was Brooklyn’s greatest resource need at the time. And besides, Brooklyn itself had annexed all nine towns in Kings County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, New Yorkers feared being overtaken by Chicago, which was rapidly growing. The pivotal event in the public mind was when Chicago beat out New York to host the 1893 World’s Fair. Everyone remembered how New York had sapped prestige from once-mighty Philadelphia when it eclipsed the City of Brotherly Love in size in 1835. Increasingly, New Yorkers viewed consolidation as the only defense against the same thing happening to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of the push to consolidate New York shows the power and necessity of a positive, definite vision in large projects. The consolidation of New York only occurred because Green offered a practical, specific argument. He believed the economies of scale from consolidation would result in cheaper mortgages, lower taxes, better jobs, and better infrastructure. The establishment of underground subways had been undermined by infighting for years and was one of the great promises of consolidation. Green painted vivid pictures of the harbors and bridges that could only be built when his goals were met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visions like that are rare today because they require thinking about what one actually wants and how to accomplish it. Picking priorities in a world of finite resources means picking winners and losers, and making enemies in the process. Negative critiques of a problem are easy because most people can agree that an obvious problem is bad. Almost no one in New York in the 1890s or San Francisco today disagrees about problems—it’s the solutions that divide people and cause established factions to block reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In politics, it is quite common for visions to end up as nothing more than broken promises. Consolidation was one of those rare causes that over-delivered and started doing so immediately after its achievement. It was no small project—voters approved consolidation in 1894, and it was completed four years later in 1898. That year, unified New York became the second-largest city in the world by population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green had been strongly motivated by the idea that a single mayor rather than five would be able to break logjams and complete public projects. After consolidation, New York had three mayors in rapid succession; each of them kept a major promise of the cause. Its first mayor, Robert Van Wyck, pushed the creation of the first subway through in his first year and provided funds for the proposed Brooklyn Tunnel. His successor, Seth Low—who had been the mayor of recalcitrant Brooklyn—fulfilled the promise of using increased scale to lower taxes and fight graft in various city agencies, especially the police. The third mayor, George McClellan, Jr., opened the first full subway line, as well as Grand Central Station, the New York Public Library, and other iconic New York institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of a united New York City also empowered mayors to resist the power of Tammany Hall, a machine of political corruption that had once seemed hegemonic. Mayors like William Jay Gaynor, who was hand-picked by Tammany Boss Charles Murphy, now had the strength to renege on their deals and support civil servants who protected projects like the expansion of the subway. Green himself, who once struggled against corruption to build the Washington Bridge across the Harlem River, created institutions like the Bronx Zoo for the benefit of all the New York boroughs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, New York is still a center of culture, finance, and power. It is even the home of the United Nations. Green’s vision of an “Imperial City” has survived for nearly 130 years.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Vision for a Greater San Francisco</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco finds itself in the same situation today as New York did over a century ago. The Bay Area is straining under the tension of cultural, economic, and political realities that are artificially separated by multiple jurisdictions. The only sustainable resolution is to collapse those realities into one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Bay Area, the idea of consolidation is not entirely new—the first attempted consolidation occurred when the city was ready to rebuild in the wake of the 1906 fire. San Franciscans had noticed the growth of Oakland, which by the end of the nineteenth century had absorbed eleven municipalities, including Temescal and Claremont, and had tried to annex Berkeley and Emeryville. A number of prominent locals decided to try and follow in New York’s footsteps. Together, they formed the Greater San Francisco Association. But this initiative offered a much smaller basket of goods than Green had: a bridge across the Bay to replace slow ferries, lower taxes, and, in a Californian twist, a municipal water district that would be supplied by the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation required a state constitutional amendment called the </span><a href="https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=ca_ballot_props"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolfe Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Chronicle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> op-ed in favor of consolidation noted that “people take pride in being in a big town. The once satisfied Brooklynite or Staten Islander likes to hail from New York.” However, the advocates of consolidation in the early 1900s failed to make the case that a Greater San Francisco would be as great as New York. The Oakland Chamber of Commerce led the charge against consolidation, and it won. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin County voted in favor of the 1912 amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the following decades, the Bay Area watched Los Angeles grow from a secondary rival to a metropolis that soon eclipsed it in population and cultural prestige. New York, meanwhile, became a global powerhouse of wealth and influence that San Francisco simply could never match.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the time of the vote, none of this was obvious or predictable. The fact is that consolidation was not compelling in the Bay Area of 1912. Economically and politically, the conditions simply did not exist. Consolidation would have been a major effort for its own sake rather than the resolution of a long-festering problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Area was becoming connected but was not yet irretrievably linked; an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland Tribune </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed arguing against consolidation pointed out that a mere six percent of Oakland residents earned their living in San Francisco. There was hardly any infrastructure connecting the wider Bay economy. None of the major bridges had yet been built; Oakland and San Francisco were primarily connected through ferries. Outside of the two major metropolises, the Bay Area’s economy was largely agricultural, not industrial. There were no economies of scale to be had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there were no compelling projects to unite anyone behind other than the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. As historian Mel Scott </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xlE4hwWVqqwC&amp;q=the+movement+for+a+metropolitan+water+district#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20movement%20for%20a%20metropolitan%20water%20district%22&amp;f=false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">observed,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the movement for a metropolitan water district thus became identified with the political consolidation movement.” Many viewed it as a simple cash grab to avoid issuing bonds for a project that didn’t need consolidation, and they were largely right: Hetch Hetchy provides water to San Francisco to this day, no consolidation required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly of all, there was no local Andrew Haswell Green. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribune </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed accused the Greater San Francisco Association of being formed in 1907 as an insidious plot well in advance of consolidation. Ironically, the problem is that it was formed too late. Green had pushed for his Imperial City for decades and been a forceful advocate with a vision of what he would accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Area of 1912 is long gone, and in its stead are all the conditions that make consolidation necessary. The Bay Area is no longer defined by a battle between two mid-size cities surrounded by rural farmland and a few wealthy vacation homes. Today, it is straining under the weight of its internal divisions. It is time to give consolidation a try again. Unlike in 1912, there is no need for a Wolfe amendment. Article XI of the California Constitution has permitted consolidation since 1988. The legal tools to create Greater San Francisco are readily available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Area’s nine counties would form the equivalent of “boroughs” in the new city. The most important element of a Greater San Francisco would be the creation of a single city administration. Instead of the highest regional government being BART, the new city could have a real government with a single mayor. There would be representation from each region, but this should also be an opportunity to avoid the </span><a href="https://roseinstitute.org/togethersf-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the past. Moving from 101 municipalities to one would also come with enormous benefits at the government level. Many Bay Area cities today are hamstrung by weak mayors who are at the mercy of various city legislators and special interests; consolidation can be used as an opportunity to wipe the slate clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Greater San Francisco would also be able to engage in rational city planning at the right scale. Right now, every city has to have a housing element that tries to impose a housing plan even on extremely small towns. A bigger city can rationalize this planning process by having a greater diversity of townships—keeping some areas rural by absorbing them into a larger city with a single housing element while placing homes in places that are meant to be dense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The removal of redundant veto players will also allow for big projects completed on reasonable timelines. In the 1960s, </span><a href="https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/the-history-of-bart-on-the-peninsula/article_a8542b55-b84f-5ff9-9e70-eedc94cbae56.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Mateo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was able to kill the southern BART expansion, severely kneecapping its ability to be a true pan-Bay transit system. This was only possible because San Mateo had the right to control its borders and public purse. In a Greater San Francisco, there would be no more rogue towns killing grand projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new city would be similar in size and population to New York City, with an economy larger than that of most countries. Rather than being unwieldy, it would provide for the simplicity of a single, coordinated response with economies of scale. It would be a big economy with manufacturing, like Tesla’s Fremont facility and the Santa Clara semiconductor complex, the South San Francisco biotech cluster, and even See’s Candies main facility, resulting in a more balanced overall economy. The police would be able to coordinate and break up crime rings as part of one large, single department instead of 50 departments, with authority that would reach across the entire Bay. A company looking to manufacture will know the zoning rules without worrying that things will change if they move ten miles away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single Greater San Francisco government for the whole Bay Area could also achieve dramatic economies of scale. One large sanitation department can get a much better deal on equipment than many small ones can. Currently, there are over </span><a href="https://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/publications_pdfs/SPUR_Seamless_Transit.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two dozen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transit agencies throughout the Bay Area and construction is horribly delayed and expensive; the </span><a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/09/12/advocates-flummoxed-and-fuming-over-latest-central-subway-delays/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Subway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a mere 1.7-mile line, cost $1.6 billion and took 11 years to complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining into a single bureaucracy can allow for the streamlining of thousands of unnecessary government officials, saving not only government salaries but, more importantly, saving </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decades</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—the time wasted by piecemeal politicians who have the incentive to block projects in the current vetocracy hellscape. The surplus politicians and bureaucrats are likely the biggest barrier to this new vision, not the legal restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the reason that New York politically consolidated despite such barriers is that it had been going in that direction for decades at an institutional level: Manhattan had already consolidated the Bronx, Brooklyn had already merged some of its departments with Manhattan’s, and there was already a desire to merge the region’s harbors. The Bay Area already has some regionally governed transit systems and bridges, and lower-level institutional consolidation is a more readily achievable goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One obvious place to start is the police. Bay Area residents are </span><a href="https://www.bayareacouncil.org/press-releases/2022-bay-area-council-poll-registers-big-jump-in-concerns-about-crime-and-safety/#:~:text=The%20Bay%20Area%20Council%20Poll%20found%20generally%20high%20levels%20of,about%20panhandling%20and%20public%20nuisances."><span style="font-weight: 400;">much more afraid of crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than they were just a few years ago, and crime rings are known to cross the entire Bay Area. In particular, a shared desire for more police coordination with established cities like Redwood City and San Jose could follow such a pathway. Merging police departments and giving them a mandate to crack down on criminal organizations operating across the Bay Area would be a decisive and visible signal of what full political consolidation could achieve. All the different fire departments and transit agencies that currently don’t work well together could all be brought under one roof, as Bay Area citizens see the power of consolidated government and wish for more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step can, and likely should, occur before political consolidation. In the case of New York, prior consolidations made the process easier and more obvious, contributing to a sense of inevitability and removing some of the opponents. Working together would show the benefits of consolidation to the entire region in its area of greatest concern and create a powerful constituency in its favor. It may also make sense for some of the smaller towns to combine as an intermediate step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidation also makes infrastructure development possible on a scale that its opponents could never counter-promise or swoop on delivering. The most dramatic of these is a seamless transit system, which was one of the major carrots of New York’s consolidation as well. Bay Area residents have long been plagued by broken transit and terrible commutes, and </span><a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2023/05/30/op-ed-consolidate-the-bay-areas-transit-agencies#:~:text=In%20a%202021%20poll%20from,with%20only%2031%20percent%20opposed."><span style="font-weight: 400;">polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find that 83 percent of voters would support merging Caltrain and BART. It is no wonder that at a 2013 conference on consolidation, the participants </span><a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/bay-area-leaders-consider-merging-region/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that transit integration would be a good place to begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With some of the worst traffic in the world and the highest percentage of super-commuters, voters would likely view a world-class transit system with higher speeds and frequency as highly motivating. Some nonprofits like Seamless Bay Area have put out a </span><a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/vision-map"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of what an integrated system could look like; they are a great start but can stand to be even more ambitious. With consolidation, such a system could arguably be built faster and cheaper per mile than without such a move. A 2011 </span><a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/Financial_Task_Summary_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Bay Area transit agencies had lower operating margins than larger, more centralized peers. This is the power of economies of scale, and the power to just make heads roll rather than shift blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the current political structures of the Bay Area, there would be winners and losers from consolidation. Other Bay Area reform movements, from YIMBYs to the tech billionaires building a city in Solano County, have generally tried to focus on mobilizing the professional classes. The reason it’s easier to try and build a whole new city rather than flip even a few local governments is because there has been no deal available toward which to turn entrenched political interests.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What matters is not money, but the ability to build these alliances. Green advocated for and achieved New York consolidation over 30 years without a great deal of wealth to his name. What he possessed was extensive personal experience in the institutions of New York. Green did not just advocate, but actually sat on commissions to implement projects that advanced his vision step by step. That willingness to engage with the actual work of sitting on boards is often what&#8217;s missing from today&#8217;s aspiring Andrew Haswell Greens. He knew the ropes, the names, and the possible alliances. And in the end, he succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle for Greater San Francisco will be long and bruising, and the involvement of several charter cities means that the state legislature will need to ultimately back the effort. But it would not be starting from ground zero as it was a century ago. What matters is a clear vision of what is at stake and a charismatic champion to advance it. Consolidation saved New York from stagnation: without it, Manhattan and Brooklyn would have remained mid-sized cities. Rather than eclipsing Chicago and London, they would have been the Eastern Minneapolis-St. Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As things stand, the scattered cities of the Bay Area will continue to buckle against the contradictions that emerge when there is no scale. Greater San Francisco can embrace the powerhouse the Bay Area has become and make a golden future possible.</span></p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the detonation of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow brought down its onion cupolas into a cloud of dust and dirt, it took a year for the Bolsheviks to remove all the debris. Once that was finally done, a steel frame sprang from the cleared soil. It was intended for the Palace of the Soviets, a concrete wedding cake-like structure planned to be the tallest building in the world at 1,365 feet, crowned with a 300-foot statue of a saluting Lenin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was never completed due to the beginning of the Second World War and its steel was salvaged for the war effort instead. But at the time, the demolition of the cathedral was only one instance of how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the overturning of an old order was transforming Moscow’s cityscape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s said that in the Moscow of 1935, it was </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Moscow-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590175859"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impossible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a contemporary map of the city. Ducking your head into a bookstore or bus station, you could find maps up to 1924. But every year since then so many new streets had been added, so many streets renamed, and so many old buildings destroyed and replaced, that there was no point in producing a new one. There was only a map of what the city was to look like in the year 1945 when the “General Reconstruction Plan” would finally be complete. Until then, Moscow was undergoing a frenetic metamorphosis of its urban fabric. As Trotsky had <a href="http://www.sovlit.net/onpilnyak/">put it</a>, “The revolution has cut time in half.” Other Bolsheviks like Yakov Sverdlov often <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176949/the-house-of-government">spoke</a> of the revolution as ushering in a “life in which people are fused into a single whole not only physically, but also spiritually.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this was merely the architectural complement of Russia’s radical transformation. A larger revolution in ideas around human nature had been underway for decades before the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution and had been fully unleashed by its arrival. This early Soviet period that transformed Moscow also spawned some of the first attempts at applied transhumanism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every few months throughout the 1930s, newspaper headlines announced that the secrets of immortality had been revealed and the creation of an elixir of life was imminent. One prominent Bolshevik, a certain Alexander Bogdanov, championed blood transfusions from the young as a source of eternal youth, so an entire commission was set up for the express purpose of supplying the Bolshevik old guard with new blood. The Soviet Academy of Sciences, meanwhile, authorized an expedition to West Africa that would investigate the feasibility of human-ape </span><a href="http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/PAPERS/ECCE/IVAPITEK.HTM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hybridization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “in the interests of science and the propagation of a natural-historical worldview among the masses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state promoted news of electrification and workers blasting through </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Stakhanov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal-mining records</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and downplayed the errant </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1930%E2%80%931933"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hungry years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that regrettably but naturally accompanied the construction of heaven on Earth. So it was easy for a suggestible observer to believe that, in the Soviet Union, the natural limitations of man were being surpassed everywhere one looked, and that as man gained mastery over the natural elements, the cosmic domain itself was about to open up to revolutionary progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of the rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky created the Society for the Study of Interplanetary Communications in 1924, capitalizing on a recent space craze—between 1923 and 1932, more than two dozen monographs on spaceflight were published in the USSR, versus just </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rockets-Glare-Spaceflight-Imagination/dp/1107639328"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. over the same period. Meanwhile, the authors of the “Biocosmist Manifesto” called for not just the privilege but the “right to exist (immortality, resurrection, rejuvenation) and the freedom to move in cosmic space.” To some, after the revolution everything and anything seemed possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the most important thinkers whose work had catalyzed this craze, Nikolai Fyodorivich Fyodorov, had died in 1903, long before its beginning. Although his philosophical work informed many of these scientific projects, he was not a communist, nor a socialist. Those seeking out Fyodorov met a demure, devout librarian in Moscow’s Rumyantsev library, just a ten-minute walk from the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. According to visiting admirers like Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Vladimir Solovyov, he behaved like a saint. Fyodorov eschewed his aristocratic background to live as a celibate ascetic and was so humble that he published none of his works while he was alive, despite his word-of-mouth fame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But very little of Fyodorov’s philosophy resembled traditional Christianity. His thought came to form the core of something that was later called “Cosmism,” a catch-all term to define a period in which spiritually-infused materialist thinkers grappled with how they could reconcile technological progress with human destiny. Because of his powerful influence on the intellectual life of his time, modern ecology, aeronautics, and systems theory all owe something to Fyodorov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, standing on the precipice of a prophesied revolution in materials science, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, we too are living in a Cosmist moment. Such technologies often come along with apparently visionary ideologies attached. But their utopian promises either fizzle out or get appropriated by the more powerful and established ideological structures they exist within. In this sense, the current ideologies that advocate a revolution in human nature through technological acceleration run the scripts of early Soviet ghostware, imprinted with Cosmist thought. Likewise, they are on track to share the same fate as Fyodorov and the cathedral he worked nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technologies of the future do not always pan out the way we would like or imagine them to. The cultural momentum and even material possibility they generate are reappropriated by those with both vision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> power.</span></p>
<h3><b>Remember the Ancestors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fyodorov’s work comes down to us mainly in the form of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy of the Common Task</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a posthumous collection of manuscripts he rarely shared outside his private correspondence. With its subject matter ranging from the demilitarization of the Earth to the colonization of the solar system, human asexual reproduction, and physical resurrection, he was self-conscious of coming off like a crank and felt his work would be more useful to readers of the future than the present. Even though it led him to refrain from public life, he was a farsighted observer of the here and now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in 1829, Fyodorov lived through the entirety of the electric nineteenth century</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Railroads, telephone wires, lightbulbs, and steel-beamed bridges sprang up all around him. As the technical achievements of modernity reached greater and greater heights, the question of what it all meant for the destiny of mankind came to the fore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mankind’s tools were increasing their destructive and salvific power simultaneously, leaving the human being himself to the wayside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fyodorov noted, though, that centuries ago Copernicus had already discerned that Earth was not the center of the universe. The librarian believed, in fact, that the rest of the universe—down to its most elementary particles—was vitally alive, but also that man was uniquely situated as the most developed, self-reflective form of life. That gave human beings the ability to feel great grief over the suffering of both human and non-human lifeforms, and over the severing of man’s connection with the land. Fyodorov was also concerned with the fading of historical memory—even the stories and experiences of our ancestors slipped through our fingers like sand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although that same self-reflective nature caused man great suffering, it equipped him to alleviate it and even to elevate the elementary particles of the universe themselves to a higher state of consciousness. This entailed the uplifting of all non-sentient life to his own level, the transcendence of his own current limited state, and a rejection of nature as such: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A]s soon as the pride in the exploits of the fathers is replaced by grief over their death, we will begin to perceive the Earth as a graveyard and nature as a death-bearing force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberating this graveyard would require the literal raising of the dead. For Fyodorov, “Our task is to make nature, the forces of nature, into an instrument of universal resuscitation and to become a union of immortal beings.” Achieving this would entail studying the remains of the dead and their escaped particulate matter in outer space, which would also have to be retrieved in order to reconstitute the whole organism.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only when all men come to participate in knowledge will pure science…cease to be indifferent to this distorted attitude of the conscious being to the uncon­scious force. Then applied science will be aimed at transform­ing instruments of destruction into means of regulating the blind death-bearing force.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His philosophy assigned what is literally a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">common</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">task</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a total mobilization of society that would execute on a theo-scientific vision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It required the demilitarization of the world’s armies, but not their disbandment. Instead, the scale of mobilization of modern militaries could be usefully redirected to weather regulation, terraforming, and massive industrial projects. Just like the way the Soviets would later adopt labor mobilization and militaristic terminology like “shock workers” for the purposes of achieving five-year plans, Fyodorov described the common task in terms of </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligentsia-Science-Russian-Century-1860-1960/dp/0226304574"><span style="font-weight: 400;">galactic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lebensraum</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The] conquest of the Path to Space is an absolute imperative, imposed on us as a duty in preparation for the Resurrection. We must take possession of new regions of Space because there is not enough space on Earth to allow the co-existence of all the resurrected generations.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mastery over nature as an imperative for human liberation and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call for “a radical technical revolution bound up with a moral one”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appealed to many Bolsheviks. In a commemoration for what would have been Fyodorov’s 100th birthday, the famous Bolshevik writer Maxim Gorky </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/591877"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “freedom without power over nature—that’s the same as freeing peasants without land.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But others found the concepts suspect. Trotsky perceptively </span><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch06.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmism seems, or may seem, extremely bold, vigorous, revolutionary, and proletarian. But in reality, Cosmism contains the suggestion of very nearly deserting the complex and difficult problems…on Earth so as to escape into the interstellar spheres. In this way Cosmism turns out quite suddenly to be akin to mysticism…[and may] lead some to the most subtle of matters, namely the Holy Ghost.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And lead to the Holy Ghost it did. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Fyodorov was devout, he saw Christianity as “not simply a doctrine of redemption, but the very task of redemption.” To him,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “General resurrection, immanent resuscitation carried out with all the heart, thought and actions—that is, by all the power and abilities—of all the sons of man, is the implementation of the precept of Christ, Son of God and also Son of Man.” Cosmism did not derive its utopian visions from the possibilities of new technology, but began with a vision—immortality and the resurrection of the dead—and asked what technology would be necessary for this common task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To a modern reader, this could all seem quite far-fetched. Indeed, that was also the case for many of his contemporaries. But for some, it was the stimulus for incredible works of genius—including the godfather of spaceflight, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cosmism Came First</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yuri Gagarin became the first man to go to space, the Soviet media reported that upon reaching orbit he “saw no God up here.” But this quip actually originated from the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev; Gagarin himself was a baptized Christian, and once publicly suggested the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070809215050/http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=interview&amp;div=24"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of retconning was a common pattern throughout Soviet history. Recasting scientific discoveries and historical moments like these for didactic purposes was an important part of building and then vindicating state ideology. To the Politburo and Central Committee, the space project was seen as a useful aid in promoting atheism as part of the state ideology. In fact, the entire Soviet space program owes itself to a Cosmist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We remember Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, born in 1857, for his theoretical work on thermal-shielded, gyroscope-steered, </span><a href="https://www.tsiolkovsky.org/en/the-cosmic-philosophy/selected-works-second-edition-konstantin-tsiolkovsky/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multistage rocket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “trains,” a topic on which he first published in 1903, and for the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which describes the way an object can move using rocket thrust. However, his work on rocketry was only one-eighth of his total research output. He was greatly influenced by Fyodorov, who “took the place of university professors” during his childhood when he studied at the Rumyantsev library. The great bulk of Tsiolkovsky’s research was actually dedicated to two things—the design of metal dirigibles and </span><a href="https://www.tsiolkovsky.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/289-tsiolkovsky-hagemeister-konstantin-tsiolkovsky-and-the-occult-roots-of-soviet-space-travel-english.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speculative writings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the cosmic will of the universe:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death is one of the illusions of the weak human mind. Death does not exist…The universe is constructed in such a way that not only [it] itself is immortal, but also all of its parts, in the form of living, blessed beings. There is no beginning and no end to the universe, and thus no beginning and no end to life and to bliss.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Tsiolkovsky, the universe tended toward more complex assemblages of atoms and molecules over time. They progressively possessed a greater capacity for self-awareness, a greater capacity for suffering, and a greater capability to alleviate it. By virtue of being the most developed assemblage, mankind was tasked with “liberating” the material universe by expanding into every one of its confines and developing its interconnectivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy of the Common Task</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Tsiolkovsky got this idea. It was also from there he would learn to speculate on the feasibility and economic viability of asteroid mining, the recapturing of particles that escaped Earth’s atmosphere, and their reimplementation into the physically resurrected dead of all human history—all of whom were slated for immortality. Colonization of other planets was, as for Fyodorov, simply a way to create a living space for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The immortal humanity of the future would itself be upgraded, and Cosmists prefigured many themes from later transhumanist ideology. Fyodorov was celibate his entire life and dreamt of non-sexual reproduction—in his lifetime, he would have to settle for intellectual influence. Even though Tsiolkovsky had seven children, he too had a contempt for human sexuality and determined that in the future, humanity would replicate the asexual reproductive technology supposedly used by Mary to birth Christ. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the Cosmists viewed all the miracles described in the Bible as not unexplainable miracles but debuts of sophisticated, reproducible technologies now lost to time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most in the orbit of Cosmist thought did not subscribe to its most radical theological ideas, its esoteric yet all-encompassing vision was enough to inspire many individual scientists and artists. Scientists and engineers influenced by Cosmist thought played leading roles in Soviet research. Ivan Yefremov created a new subfield of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Yefremov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paleontology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sergei Korolev and Valentin Glushko designed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Glushko"><span style="font-weight: 400;">satellites and rocket engines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Soviet space program, and Leonid Krasin directed the preservation of Lenin’s body in anticipation of his </span><a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-03/russian-cosmism-inspiring-putin-and-musk-with-ideas-of-immortality-and-space-colonization.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this moment of Cosmist ascendancy, it seemed like their visions of transforming human life into new forms were gaining ground across the world. The Cosmist geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky directly influenced the famous French Jesuit thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Together, they developed the concept of the noosphere, a plane of collective consciousness emerging from organic life once it begins to contemplate itself, finally culminating in a higher order of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just as the Cosmist project appeared to reach newfound heights of influence, it found itself in the process of dissolution. The most useful aspects of Cosmism were incorporated into the state ideology of the Soviet space program even as they were stripped of their original justifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sergei Korolev, the designer of the Sputnik satellite, was himself a great fan of both Fyodorov and Tsiolkovsky—he even wrote an introduction to a published collection of Tsiolkovsky’s work. But the ideological inspiration he brought to the Soviet space project operated within the state-approved paradigm of Soviet science, which demanded “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the propagation of a natural-historical worldview among the masses” rather than resurrection and immortality. Tsiolkovsky may have become influential in his old age but his most fundamental goals died with him. Cosmism enjoyed an ephemeral and semi-prestigious influence but no prominent exponent thereafter was motivated by its core theological and material vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structurally, the problem was that Cosmism, which never amounted to more than its thinkers, had neither the mechanisms nor even the ideological commitment to its own implementation. Like Cosmism, the ideology of communism had a life that preceded its entrenchment in the Soviet state. But what made communism different was its explicit bid for political power and the creation of organizational structures like the Leninist mass party, which was tasked with achieving that goal and enforcing party discipline along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This combination of globally-scoped ideology and strategic institution-building made communism a uniquely successful historical project in a way that Cosmism, as a philosophical movement, could not be. Fyodorov put off his writings for readers of the future, and there never was a “Cosmist International.” Karl Marx, on the other hand, was laying the institutional groundwork for the Communist Party at the same time as he was writing screeds in a Brussels garret in 1848.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant that the Cosmist project had no self-defense mechanisms against its own appropriation for Soviet political goals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not unique in this way: those prophets who undertake the creation of new technological and philosophical paradigms may get to enjoy fame and even paid positions for their work if they are fortunate, but they are usually not driven by material incentives. Tsiolkovsky was famously irascible and Fyodorov was reluctant to get published at all, even shying away from the salons and admiration of famous intellectuals to focus instead on his library and theorizing the retrieval of past human beings like books. This meant that much of their influence was posthumous and passed through a Soviet filter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bastardization of Cosmism into atheist Soviet ideology makes clear that the most successful ideological projects must have both a radical impetus </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a viable route for political implementation. Ideologies that lack the latter become vulnerable to recuperation into existing power structures. The ideologies that govern history are implemented by states, not the visionaries who conceive them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Tsiolkovsky’s contributions to the study of dirigibles were honored and rewarded by the Soviet government, which was engaged in the “airship race” of the 1930s. Before that, he had been living off <a href="https://isaran.ru/?q=ru/delo&amp;ida=1&amp;guid=4F0E3451-777D-CECD-4F4B-7C8848D2B419">five</a> loaves of bread a month until a representative of his hometown authored an urgent report to the Soviet Academy of Sciences advocating a pension for him. Yet the ideas that inspired this research were not propagated beyond those with an intellectual bent toward esoteric ideology. Although we live in a world with the technological capabilities envisioned by Cosmists, we do not live in a universe according to Cosmism.</span></p>
<h3><b>Our Cosmist Moment?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cosmists were responding to a world that was beginning to undergo one collective experience, as communication and transportation technologies seemed on the way to connecting all advanced societies into a single noosphere. This gathering of the nations meant that the destiny of mankind could be conceptualized in collective terms. Even if the Cosmists and other Soviets of the 1920s and ‘30s over-indexed on technology’s ability to make a resurrected humanity immortal, they were looking at their material conditions and speculating on what could be achieved one or five hundred years into the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cosmist experience casts a new light on the recent nexus of technological breakthroughs. Today, the very form of the human being is challenged by the possibility of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">human modification on a genetic or biochemical level and the rise of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intellectual capabilities. Embryonic selection for height and intelligence is </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/12/12/political-academia-with-stephen-hsu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possible, and in some corners already practiced, although explicit advocacy of these technologies remains on the fringe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While AI is more recent, there are already </span><a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rumblings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a new ideology that seeks to prioritize its full development as a cure for human ills and material stagnation, possibly replacing the human race in the process. In the minds of many speculators, these technologies travel together as a group, and their arrival necessitates the disappearance of human agency and sometimes even human life from the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the frequent pose of being purely empirical claims, these speculations are often laundered through ideologies like transhumanism that have their own ready ideas of what the human or posthuman form should become. One relevant question, then, is what visions actually motivate current technological advances, even in hidden or non-obvious ways. Another is whether these ideologies can survive on their own merits at all, or whether they will face appropriation of their best ideas into entirely new contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aradigm breakthroughs always begin with calls to great, even fantastical endeavors—to “storm the heavens,” as Fyodorov once implored his followers to do. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Cosmism’s attempts at articulating a human project were kooky in certain respects, a great deal of tangible scientific progress emerged from its admirers. New, totalizing theories of human purpose are likely yet to emerge. Some will inspire their own waves of material experimentation and invention. But to the degree that they are reliant on more hegemonic patrons, they will likely share the fate of the Cosmists before them.</span></p>

			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will never forget the sunset when I first saw the solar system with my naked eyes. I was standing on the deck of a boat plodding slowly through the Nile River, closer to Sudan than to the Mediterranean Sea. I had not yet seen the Egyptian night sky, so I was excited to be so far south, with so much unlit desert on either side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, I was early. The Sun was still illuminating the western horizon. I didn’t plan it that way, but it was too bright to see the stars, yet dark enough to see the Moon and the gleaming dots of Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. As it dawned on me that I was seeing five distant planets at once, it dawned on me also that they were all in a perfectly straight line across the sky, perpendicular to the Earthly horizon that tells us we are standing up straight and balanced. All of a sudden, I wasn’t standing on a boat. I was falling face-forward and down the side of the Earth, an incomprehensibly large sphere suspended in an invisible flat disk of planets surrounding a star.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our animal eyes can observe planets, stars, and even the heart of our galaxy as much as they can observe mountaintops or ocean waves. It is a reminder that our natural habitat on Earth requires at least three separate planetary bodies. The Sun’s light and heat make the Earth habitable. So does the Moon, through gravitational stabilization of the Earth’s tilt and rotation, which keeps the days 24 hours long and the seasons regular and mild. Perhaps the Earth is not our natural habitat, but only a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This poses an existential problem because it means we cannot think of ourselves as only a terrestrial species. We rightly believe that we must take care of our natural environment. But drawing the border of our natural environment at the Earth’s atmosphere is only a convention. This boundary helps us feel like we are masters of our fate, since our economic and technological capacity to affect the Earth is currently far greater than our capacity to affect the rest of the solar system, let alone the cosmos. If we are not only a terrestrial species, then what are we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the nineteenth century, we have known that the Earth is not the world, but an infinitesimal part of it. The combined knowledge and power of humanity, therefore, extends only to an infinitesimal part of the world, with the rest a seemingly infinite mystery. Perhaps the most common response to this is to throw up one’s hands and say that this has shown humanity is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. But this is not a way to incorporate the scale of the cosmos into our understanding of humanity, but a denial of the importance of humanity altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only in the twentieth century that this view came to predominate, as we grew wary of nuclear apocalypse and fretted over mishandling an Earth we felt was already trampled beneath our feet. The Copernican Revolution in the sixteenth century began as a triumph of human experimentation and observation over handed-down knowledge. In the eighteenth century, Voltaire was already prophesying </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microm%C3%A9gas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">universal man</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, truly at the scale of the universe. In the nineteenth century, the cosmos was taken to mean a wealth of resources and knowledge to use in the inevitable future when we conquered even this otherworldly part of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unresolved existential problem became a political one. A theory of human beings as irrelevant, confined and small in time and space, results in political systems that seek to keep human beings small. The byproduct is the ascendancy of alternative ideological projects like “</span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-german-retreat-from-nuclear-power"><span style="font-weight: 400;">degrowth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” which seek to put humans back in their place as minor fauna, or like summoning an artificial superintelligence that will either drive us to extinction or, with luck, keep us around as tiny pets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scale of the cosmos has not shown that we are irrelevant, but that we simply do not know enough about the world to know our relationship to it. As a species, most of our greatest philosophers, intellectuals, and spiritual leaders lived before the Space Age. Their answers to the questions posed by the cosmos reflected the state of their scientific knowledge, which was, in fact, </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/05/17/why-civilization-is-older-than-we-thought/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more advanced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than we typically assume. But they ultimately lived in a terrestrial world. Since men first walked on the Moon in 1969, we have not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To have a flourishing future as a civilization, we have no choice but to resolve the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anthropological</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problem posed by space: what it means to be human will be ultimately determined by how we respond to the question of space, which will itself determine how we organize our societies. To ignore this question is also to ignore an already integral part of human nature—we are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de facto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already a space-faring animal, the only such animal on this planet. Moreover, this question cannot be answered through philosophy alone, because space is not abstract, but physical and full of surprises. The only way to answer it is empirical: to explore space ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To complete our understanding of humanity, there are no alternatives to a spacefaring future to the limits of the known universe. Until that time, our book on what humanity is must continue to have blank pages to write on, with room to revise our ideas in light of the natural revelation of the universe. From where we sit today, space will thus twice transform what it means to be human. First, because of what we find—or do not find—among the stars. Second, because the economic, organizational, and technological challenges required to reach the stars at all will require us to alter our social, political, and moral structures.</span></p>
<h3><b>To Explore Space Is To Transform Humanity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we usually reverse this entailment, with the exploration of space justified on economic, diplomatic, or scientific grounds. For example, NASA’s </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/value-of-nasa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literature argues that the agency grows the economy, fosters international cooperation, and drives innovations that improve daily life. Technologies like rockets and satellites have always helped build and use more powerful weapons, so there is also a military justification. But while these are all useful side effects of space exploration, they fall short of a justification for space exploration in and of itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the popular imagination, the Space Age is closely associated with America’s era of consumer prosperity since the 1950s. Accomplishments in space are taken as the results of a wider and inevitable trend of economic growth, technological progress, and eventual world peace led by the United States. Alongside images of the Statue of Liberty and cattle ranchers on the Great Plains, the last page of every U.S. passport shows a space probe floating past the Moon into deep space. If space exploration is inevitable, then perhaps it needs no justification. But what if space exploration wasn’t an inevitable side effect of progress, but instead driven by dedicated, </span><a href="https://samoburja.com/great-founder-theory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with mystical beliefs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the modern idea of space exploration and—importantly—the technology to make it happen emerged from the era of war, revolution, and economic misery of the early twentieth century, especially in Germany and the Soviet Union. Three men independently derived the equation describing how a rocket can escape the Earth&#8217;s gravity: the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903, the American Robert Goddard in 1912, and the German Hermann Oberth in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he launched the first-ever liquid-fueled rocket in Massachusetts in 1926, the more reclusive Goddard never inspired a wider community of practice in his home country. Both Tsiolkovsky and Oberth did. From the 1920s to the 1930s, a generation of amateur rocket scientists and enthusiasts in Europe conducted the formative research and experimentation that, within a few decades of starting from nothing, would result in arsenals of thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and launches of both men and machines to other planets. Among these enthusiasts were the young future heads of both the U.S. and Soviet space programs: Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they would later gain government patronage by building missiles, the first rocketeers were fanatically motivated, almost without exception, by the prospect of space exploration. For von Braun, it began when, as an adolescent, he read Hermann Oberth’s 1923 book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rocket Into Interplanetary Space</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which argued that space travel was feasible with rockets. Full of mathematical equations and dry technical language, a colleague of Oberth&#8217;s later quipped that the book “might as well have been printed in Sumerian characters.” The book nonetheless also persuaded the Austrian science writer Max Valier and the German university student Willy Ley, both of whom resolved to help Oberth popularize this dense but groundbreaking work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1927, Oberth, Valier, Ley, and a few other German space enthusiasts founded the “Society for Space Travel” to raise funds for rocketry experiments and promote the idea of space exploration. Collaborating with Opel, the car company, they launched the first German liquid-propellant rocket in 1929. In 1930, a determined, eighteen-year-old von Braun sought out and joined the society. According to a history of space travel that von Braun </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-rocketry-space-travel-Wernher/dp/B0006CPENU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-authored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> late in his life, “virtually all of the civilian experimenters and promoters were much more interested in what the rocket could do, theoretically at least, to further their dreams of visiting the Moon and planets, than in rocketry itself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev met the Russian space evangelist Fridrikh Tsander that same year. Korolev was then a newly-graduated “aeromechanical” engineer working on military aircraft. Tsander, six years earlier, had founded the “Society for the Study of Interplanetary Communications” in Moscow. An early devotee of both Oberth and Tsiolkovsky, Tsander named his two children “Mercury” and “Astra” and greeted his colleagues with “Onward to Mars!” Korolev joined Tsander to found an amateur rocketry organization in 1931. By 1932, Korolev was leading the group. In 1933, they successfully launched the first Soviet liquid-propellant rocket. Celebrating, Korolev wrote in a flier that “Soviet rockets must conquer space!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest in rocketry and spaceflight was not recreational. Nor was it military, though both amateur rocket organizations would be directly adopted into the R&amp;D programs of the German and Soviet militaries. Rather, while their exact ideas differed widely, the rocketeers themselves all strongly believed that space travel would fundamentally transform humanity’s conception of itself and its place in the universe, necessarily transforming the future of human civilization to come. Space travel was a means to revolutionize not only economics or government, but humanity itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsiolkovsky, for example, purportedly said he only studied rocketry to assist his philosophical research. He </span><a href="https://www.tsiolkovsky.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/290-tsiolkovsky-klafkowski-cosmic-philosophy-and-science-fiction-english-2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that humanity was destined to expand throughout the cosmos, where life without gravity would allow us to evolve into a more perfect form, including by having much larger brains. He believed the existence of extraterrestrial life was axiomatically true and, moreover, that they were probably smarter than us, who are </span><a href="https://www.tsiolkovsky.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102-planets-are-inhabited-by-living-creatures-english.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “dogs and monkeys.” His </span><a href="http://www.astronautix.com/t/thefoundatiofthespaceage.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sixteen-point plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for space exploration began with designing rocket planes and ended with “achievement of individual and social perfection,” followed by interstellar colonization when the Sun begins to die in the distant future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tsiolkovsky, an atheist and communist, the universe was strictly material. Humans </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/konstantin-tsiolkovsky-slept-here-32294363/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> simply “marionettes, mechanical puppets” of the universe, but every atom was “alive.” He imagined living beings on the Moon and on asteroids, with humanity as but one of many manifestations of a single universal life. He wrote in 1911 that “Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in the cradle forever.” Tsiolkovsky would be read not just in Russia by Tsander, Korolev, and their future colleagues in the Soviet space program, but also by Wernher von Braun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Germans had their own ideas. In 1924, Oberth and Valier were </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19770006050"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exchanging letters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, trying to figure out how to get to space. The first step, they agreed, was the publication of Oberth’s work in a form accessible to the layman. If it became popular, funds could be raised to build a rocket. Listing the key topics he would cover in his next book, Oberth noted the expected points on rocket physics and the speculative habitability of other planets. Point five, however, included “is there a soul,” “the enigma of the universe,” “mechanical effects for the phenomena of consciousness,” “telepathy,” “why do all religions locate the seat of the good angels up above,” “the fiasco of the religions of revelation,” and “parapsychologic experiments beyond the atmosphere of the Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finishing this list, Oberth correctly noted that “one must think a great deal here,” if one “does not want to be immediately torn into one thousand shreds by uncomplimentary criticism.” In reply, Valier wisely advised Oberth to “dismiss your point five and all other delicate points without fail” if he wished to be taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether fortunately or unfortunately, it seems that Oberth heeded this advice. His next major work in 1929, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways to Spaceflight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, did not mention any of these “delicate” topics. But in a brief section discussing the reasons to explore Mars, Oberth—managing to cite both of the impenetrable German philosophers Immanuel Kant and Oswald Spengler—launched into an extended explanation of his “fundamental condition for human intelligence,” defined as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquiring</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inheriting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knowledge. He reasoned that, given the rarity of this quality among the animals of Earth, “it is highly improbable that this property should repeat itself anywhere else in the cosmos.” In contrast to Tsiolkovsky, Oberth imagined humanity as a uniquely intelligent animal in the universe, much as we are on the Earth itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valier, for his part, was not trying to rain on Oberth’s parade. He wrote to Oberth that “what bids me personally to support your invention of the rocket” was to prove or disprove the pseudoscientific theory of glacial cosmogony, or the “world ice theory,” in which he strongly believed. This theory posited that, among other things, the asteroids, the Moon, and even the Milky Way galaxy were made of ice. The icy Moon periodically crashed into the Earth, which is what happened in the Biblical flood and was, furthermore, responsible for the destruction of Atlantis. For Valier, the new theory “means a new vision of the world and a new philosophy of life.” Valier’s advice to Oberth, it seems, was purely for PR reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willy Ley </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rockets-future-travel-beyond-stratosphere/dp/B0007DOG6Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1944 that the “great dream” of space travel was “philosophic wonder whether the Earth, and humanity on it, are alone in the universe or whether there are other earths with other humanities.” Ley would later become one of von Braun&#8217;s key allies in popularizing the nascent space program in the United States through articles, lectures, books, and, with the help of none other than </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/disneys-board-oversees-us-cultural"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walt Disney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, films and television programs too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, the appeal of the ambition to explore space was not scientific, economic, military, or technological, or even just ambition for its own glorious sake. Rather, the first rocketeers had existential questions or anthropological visions, which they were convinced could be answered or manifested, respectively, through the exploration of space. Despite a diversity of views on what space might mean for humanity, they shared a conviction to discover the answer empirically with rocketry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the end of World War II, Wernher von Braun wrote his one and only novel, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars%3A_A_Technical_Tale"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Mars</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about a near-future expedition to the Red Planet that discovers friendly, subterranean Martians from a dying civilization. In the book’s preface, he noted his intention was to “offer opportunities for ruminative philosophical reflection.” One of the main characters in the story addresses the future world government to argue for funding a Mars mission. He says “rocket scientists” were not motivated by the desire to build weapons, but “animated by secret visions of reaching into the heavens, of bringing their fellow men closer to what all our primitive ancestors felt was the outward manifestation of the Deity, and which was by them so worshiped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking through his fictional characters, von Braun saw the rationale for space travel as fundamentally mystical and religious. He dismissed the arguments that great explorers or inventors throughout history were motivated by economic goals, but rather by “some mystic longing” and the “divine urge.” In von Braun’s telling, the arrival of human beings on Mars was, to the dying Martians, “but final confirmation of the universally held, deep, religious conviction that God had created Man in His own image, wherever Man was to be found.” It is humans who have “brought together the germ plasms of rational creation in our solar system that they may thrive and grow into a higher and more noble organism, which shall envelope the depths of space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man who put Americans on the Moon was not overly concerned with whether space travel would create more jobs or lead to better consumer goods. Instead, he evidently believed that God himself had endorsed space colonization as the destiny of humanity, where, out there among the stars, we would no less than encounter our fellow believers. His character concludes a speech: “Only through God has the door to our neighbors in space been opened! Shall we slam it in His face?”</span></p>
<h3><b>Why Space Still Holds Mysteries</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of at least 100,000,000,000 stars in the Milky Way, we have begun to explore only 1. We essentially rely on two technologies to reduce this ignorance: telescopes and rockets. Both face severe limitations in gaining meaningful information about the cosmos. The sheer vastness of space is by far the most significant limitation because it divides all space ambitions into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">interplanetary</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ones that can be accomplished within our own solar system and those that require </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">interstellar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> travel to other stars. Even with roughly existing technology, we could conceivably send humans to the outer reaches of the solar system and back within one lifetime. A trip to Mars, for example, would take a couple of years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the star system nearest to ours, Alpha Centauri, is four light-years away—four times the distance that light, the fastest known thing in the universe, travels in one year. The fastest spacecraft we have ever launched into space </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/us-lawmaker-orders-nasa-plan-trip-alpha-centauri-100th-anniversary-moon-landing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would take</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 18,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri. The Milky Way is 100,000 light-years in diameter. Even if we could travel close to the speed of light, we would only ever cover a tiny fraction of the galaxy in one lifetime. It isn&#8217;t all bad news. There are </span><a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/50lys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two thousand stars within fifty light-years of Earth. But right now, telescopes are somewhat more informative than rockets, since the light of even unfathomably distant stars has already traveled the distance.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_6656" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6656" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6656" src="https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/50lys.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6656" class="wp-caption-text">Richard Powell, Atlas of the Universe/A map of stars within 50 light-years of the Sun</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you try to stargaze during a full moon, you will discover that the light pollution from the Moon makes it impossible to see most stars. We have a similar problem with our view of the cosmos from even the dark places in our solar system: we can’t see anything because it’s all obscured by starlight, which makes it nearly impossible for us to see the relatively tiny and dim planets orbiting them. Our telescopes can easily observe stars and galaxies because they are so big and bright. But humans will never walk on stars or galaxies. We will walk on planets. The most pressing anthropological questions will be resolved at human scale, not galactic scale. For example, whether or not other habitable planets, extraterrestrial life, or alien civilizations exist, and what their exact nature is, are questions that are not likely to be answered satisfactorily without the ability to survey planets and planet-sized objects, whether from near or afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the 1990s, we have discovered thousands of planets outside the solar system. The dominant technique is called transit photometry. Simplified, a telescope observes a star until a planet passes in front of it, dimming the star&#8217;s brightness slightly. Observing the dimming, we can infer a planet exists. This technique has a big advantage: it also allows us to guess the temperature and atmospheric composition of the planet, two of the key factors for human habitability. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, has already been able to </span><a href="https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-telescope-detects-light-from-a-small-earth-like-planet-and-finds-its-missing-its-atmosphere"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rule out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the habitability of some planets this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem with transit photometry is that it can only observe planets in the direct line of sight between Earth and a far-away star. But the bigger problem is that, like all our techniques, it is indirect. The sizes, temperatures, orbits, and presumed atmospheres of extrasolar planets are important information. But such information about planet Earth would yield a very small proportion of all information about Earth that is relevant to humanity. It is useful to narrow down, through exclusion, the candidates for human-habitable planets in the galaxy. But we cannot use it to confirm habitability beyond reasonable doubt, nor does it tell us anything meaningful about the uninhabitable planets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temperature and atmosphere readings are meaningful only because we have a theory of life, based on our experience on Earth, that tells us life requires a certain temperature and atmosphere. But we have no experience of extraterrestrial life. Moreover, we know that our direct experience of the universe amounts to less than one out of billions of stars in our galaxy alone. The weight of our direct experience compared to the weight of our known ignorance should mean that, by default, we treat any thesis about the cosmos as effectively baseless speculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are rather prone to do the opposite. For decades, large telescopes like the now-decommissioned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico have been used to try to detect radio or laser transmissions from intelligent aliens. The search remains unsuccessful. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fermi paradox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asks why, if the stars and planets are so visibly numerous, we have not yet found convincing evidence of other advanced civilizations in the universe. The logical chain of reasoning in the Fermi paradox yields a universe replete with Earth-like planets capable of sustaining life, that has mysteriously failed to produce enough intelligent alien civilizations for at least one to be detected in a century. But this assumes far too much about the cosmos based only on the experiences of a single planet in a single solar system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have so little hard evidence about the cosmos that we can’t even say with confidence that other habitable planets exist anywhere else at all, let alone assume what the character and development of alien life, if it even exists, would be. If these assumptions are in fact grossly unjustified by default, due to the unfavorable balance of given evidence compared to potential evidence, then it is not a paradox that we must resolve, but a profound ignorance that we must illuminate. How do we know that contemporary cosmology is not, in fact, as wrong as geocentrism was before Copernicus?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to overcome hard physical challenges, our ability to generate new and increasingly esoteric theories has far outpaced our ability to actually collect physical evidence from the universe. Our stance towards space, in both theory and practice, has then not been the ideal program for understanding our place in the cosmos, but rather </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cope</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for being unable to send people and probes to conduct human’s-eye view space empiricism in the field. What we are lacking is empirical science that goes out to collect evidence on which to base theories, rather than creating more elaborate theories to fit the scattershot evidence that we have and which we know is woefully insufficient. Any serious program of space exploration must always begin on the basis that the ultimate goal is interstellar travel to visit and survey extrasolar planets, no matter how hard that might be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether through gigantic telescopes, robotic probes, or manned missions, such surveying will not merely incrementally advance the progress of natural science, but will tremendously strengthen or weaken all human theories, arguments, ideologies, beliefs, and visions of the future. If we find habitable planets with life chemically compatible with our own, the argument in favor of universal life becomes that much stronger. If not, how deeply can we adapt to truly exotic environments, and what kind of people will we become if we do? Whether alien civilizations make war is a literally existential question for the whole human species—assuming aliens exist at all. Thousand-year-old schools of thought will need to suddenly change or be rendered obsolete—new and trendy ones will too. There are many more transformative questions and more still that are currently unthinkable. Any one of them will permanently alter the trajectory of human civilization. It is also possible that the entire cosmos is as barren as the Moon. What then?</span></p>
<h3><b>The Rise and Fall of Spacism</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky supported the Bolshevik Revolution and bequeathed his life’s work to the Soviet state. Wernher von Braun notoriously led the German missile program during World War II and was a member of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allgemeine-SS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, in one respect, both men were far closer to each other than to their nominal countrymen and co-ideologues. Their implacable focus on the transformative potential of space transcended other ideological commitments regarding class, race, or nation. What they really and effectively believed were different variants of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spacism. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no empty label: when the Soviets occupied Germany’s rocket facilities in 1945, they found their own classified pre-war rocket designs among von Braun’s personal belongings. The rocketeers in America, Germany, and the Soviet Union had in fact maintained correspondence with each other since the early 1920s, </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0734151042000240782?journalCode=ghat20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Robert Goddard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1950s and 1960s, the two most powerful states ever to exist—the United States and the Soviet Union—decided to explore space, devoting unprecedented resources and the state’s paramount legitimacy. Paradoxically, both states gave up on space in the 1970s, immediately after achieving a streak of the most technically and organizationally impressive feats in all of human history, beginning with the launch of the first-ever satellite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sputnik</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1957 and ending with the Apollo program that put the first men on the Moon. Only twelve people have ever walked on the Moon—the last in 1972, now over fifty years ago. Rather than the beginning of a new era in human history, the first man on the Moon became the end of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after the Moon landing in 1969, Wernher von Braun was preparing plans for a manned Mars mission, with the public support of the Vice President. The plan included lunar orbital stations and surface bases, as well as a nuclear-powered shuttle for Earth-Moon transport. But in von Braun’s </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/Michael-Neufeld/dp/0307389375"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own words</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “the question of what we are going to do [&#8230;] once we get there,” was a “weak point.” Though he made detailed plans, telling the U.S. Senate that ships would depart for Mars on precisely November 12, 1981, von Braun was personally skeptical that he could sell the Mars mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the star-studded dinner party for the returning astronauts, hosted in Los Angeles by President Richard Nixon, protesters had hung a giant sign off a nearby building that said “Fuck Mars.” Democrats wanted social spending. Republicans, including Nixon, wanted to save money, especially for the Vietnam War. Neither cared to put transcendent visions above the mundane realities of political spending. Von Braun and his team believed NASA&#8217;s budget might need to double to make a Mars mission feasible.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the 1971 government budget slashed NASA spending to a level that could not sustain the production of the powerful Saturn V rockets, which had carried men to the Moon, let alone provide enough funds to put men on Mars. Depressed, von Braun retired from NASA in 1972.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_6655" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6655" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-6655" src="https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/zlVpYNfL-vonbraunmarscollage-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/zlVpYNfL-vonbraunmarscollage-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-450x450.jpeg 450w, https://pdmedia.b-cdn.net/2023/08/vonbraunmarscollage-600x600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6655" class="wp-caption-text">NASA/Detailed slides from Wernher von Braun&#8217;s 1969 presentation to the Space Task Group on a manned Mars mission planned for 1981</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Moon landing did not actually diminish the ambitions of the Soviets, who, under Korolev, had always regarded the Moon as a secondary goal to Venus or Mars. But Korolev had died of health problems in 1966 at the age of just 59. His successor presided over four catastrophic launch failures of the Soviet answer to the Saturn V, the N1-L3 rocket, upon which rested any Soviet dreams of Moon landings or beyond. Starting in 1974, the rocket program was not just suspended and then canceled by Soviet leadership, but the rockets were </span><a href="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4408pt1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">physically destroyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the orders of Valentin Glushko, Korolev&#8217;s erstwhile rival and the new head of the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only were Soviet political leaders averse to the long-term spending required for a Mars mission, but they were rumored to be afraid that a successful launch of the N1 would also necessitate greater immediate spending. They literally preferred not to succeed. Given the demonstrated aversion of both the U.S. and Soviet governments to allotting the requisite resources for space exploration, the question is rather why they agreed to expensive space programs in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit for starting the Space Race in fact goes to Sergei Korolev, who first secured government support for non-military applications of rockets. In 1953, armed with some suggestive American newspaper clippings, he argued to his superiors that the U.S. was planning to launch the first-ever satellite into orbit, but that his team could beat them to it. In reality, the U.S. was years away from doing so. Von Braun had not yet even met </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/disneys-board-oversees-us-cultural"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walt Disney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korolev, for the first time, formally requested that the Soviet government support “the study of interplanetary space.” He wasted no time organizing a coalition, enlisting both the Soviet Academy of Sciences and top members of the military, whom he knew professionally, to lend their support. The key report concluded with a discussion of manned spaceflight, building an orbital space station, and a mission to the Moon. Arguing the potential military applications, Korolev got the approval of the defense minister and of Soviet leader Georgy Malenkov. With Stalin still recently dead, Korolev played his cards just right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. entry into the Space Race thus essentially followed the culmination of Korolev’s successful deployment of his social capital and persuasive skill in the Soviet government. Following the launch of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sputnik</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, NASA was created in early 1958 with President Dwight Eisenhower’s personal support, as a response to the perceived threat—and accompanying panic—of Soviet technological advancements represented by the satellite. In 1960, von Braun and his team were transferred from the military to NASA. With his famous 1961 speech declaring America would put a man on the Moon, President John F. Kennedy invested his tremendous political capital into the space program, but, ultimately, </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/15/the-political-machine-behind-the-apollo-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a means of demonstrating superiority over the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Space Race was the result of a few key live players like Korolev persuading and, to some degree, disingenuously frightening their governments that an ideological and geopolitical enemy might obtain a military advantage. While their private motivations were to pursue space exploration for anthropological reasons, they did not argue this view to governments in asking for support. As a result, the governments never actually adopted space exploration as a worthy goal in and of itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Space Race era gave way to a relative thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the first talks and treaties to limit ICBMs beginning in the late 1960s. Since the space program was instrumental to military goals, a decrease in military tensions threatened its funding. When it had outlived its usefulness in the 1970s, the funding was predictably withdrawn by both states. From von Braun’s perspective, it was only Kennedy’s intervention and resounding endorsement that had made the Apollo program possible in the first place. According to von Braun, the future space program needed defense “with philosophical if not religious zeal,” but Washington was only interested in cost-effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space exploration, however, was never just a government program. It was also a set of beliefs and ambitions. What must be explained is not only why governments wound down spending, but why this new and potent proposition failed to attract more—and more powerful—adherents who would find new justifications for its continuation. Despite being the greatest act of “propaganda of the deed” in human history, the Moon landing decisively failed to persuade the relevant decision-makers of the time that a Mars mission was worth pursuing next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both budgets and programs were cut. No political player in the U.S. intervened to preserve von Braun’s government career and, in the Soviet Union, none intervened to preserve Korolev’s rockets. To this day, NASA arguably only still exists because the U.S. government doesn’t know how to delete bureaucracies. Why did successful space exploration fail to persuade that it was worth the expense? An underrated explanation is that space exploration apparently failed on its own anthropological terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From roughly the 1890s to the 1960s, there was a genuine and tangible mystery within our own solar system that was large enough to leave space for Martian civilizations. For a time, believing in life on Mars—even intelligent life—was an intellectually defensible, if outré, position. During the turn of the century, the American astronomer Percival Lowell, the scion of a very prominent Boston family, made a name for himself by arguing that he had discovered intricate networks of canals on Mars through his observatory, popularizing the idea of alien civilizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikola Tesla himself was convinced that he had once received radio communications from the Martians. Guglielmo Marconi, the famed inventor of radio, also once floated the theory that Martians were sending messages to Earth. In 1924, when Mars came into its closest proximity to Earth in a century, the U.S. Navy </span><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/radio-signals-from-mars"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all its radio stations to report any “electrical phenomenon” of “unusual character.” As late as 1960, President Eisenhower’s science advisor Fred Singer was speculating that the Martian moon Phobos might be of artificial origin. Von Braun himself had used the idea of Martians in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Mars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal of this at the time was the same as that of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence—though tarnished after decades—is today: intelligent living beings, new technology, superior ethics, and answers about the nature of life, consciousness, and the universe. All of this, and its eternally transformative potential on humanity, was perhaps within our grasp. But the success of space exploration led to its own defeat. By 1965, NASA&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariner 4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probe had captured the first photos of Mars from space, with no canals to be found, let alone Martians. By 1976, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viking 1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rover had successfully landed on Mars. The Soviets, meanwhile, had landed rovers on Venus and sent back photos of the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of evidence for any advanced life in the solar system only became more obvious, while we slowly came to terms with the difficulty of interstellar travel. Our solar system looks dead and barren; had we discovered Martians, or anything else of interest, it is hard to see how this wouldn’t have become the central defining feature of all political, intellectual, and perhaps even economic life since. But we never did. We&#8217;re less sure of the universe as a whole, but our confidence has been wounded. Scientists and engineers themselves, not just political or economic elites, lost interest in the heavens and turned inward towards other goals. Without an attainable promise of transforming humanity, how could space exploration regain its appeal?</span></p>
<h3><b>The Economics and Politics of Space Exploration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible that there are no good economic reasons to explore space. Resource extraction on other planetary bodies, such as asteroid mining, sounds like the strongest economic justification for space exploration in principle since there is far more matter out there than down here. For example, the asteroid </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/asteroid-16-psyche-may-be-worth-more-than-planet-earth-at-10-quintillion-in-fine-metals-180979303/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 Psyche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been estimated to contain $10 quintillion worth of minerals like nickel and iron—this is 400,000 times the entire annual GDP of the United States. Energy generation in space, such as by solar power satellites, has similarly overwhelming fundamentals. The Sun’s light easily contains </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/photovoltaics-give-credibility-to"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> energy to power civilizations thousands of times more energy-hungry than ours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main economic problem is not the untold capital investment, technological advancement, or long-term coordination necessary to make use of these resources, but rather that it is unclear what anyone would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $10 quintillion worth of nickel or unlimited solar energy. 16 Psyche is perhaps about 10 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">million</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> billion tons of iron and nickel. For comparison, the whole world </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/589945/iron-ore-production-gross-weight-worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">produced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2.6 billion tons of iron in 2022. We might make iron and nickel effectively free. But to what end? Far from the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limits to growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being the limits of a single planet, we, despite propaganda to the contrary, do not have an economy that voraciously consumes resources. Such gargantuan inputs of matter and energy are important for an industrial economy that is growing faster than its resource base. Ours is a sluggish economy that grows slowly, if at all, since 1971.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world where developed countries are both deindustrializing and facing structural population decline. Governments and international organizations deliberately aim to reduce industrial activity and energy consumption for environmental reasons. Fertility rates continue to decline in both the developed and developing worlds and the future expected human population declines along with them. Whether we look at China, India, or even Africa, it seems that, counterintuitively, developing countries might decline demographically before they ever reach the living standards of the developed world. No country, </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-rising-chinese-nuclear-industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including China</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has a vision of development that surpasses that of the currently developed world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as our total expected resource consumption faces an immediate and long-term decline, the Earth is nowhere close to depleting its natural resources. Relatively straightforward technological advances like </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-global-effects-of-the-us-fracking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as simply more surveying and resource exploration, have led to estimates of reserves of everything from fossil fuels to rare earth elements being repeatedly revised up, even in unexpected places like the </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/europe-comes-last-in-the-race-for"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mediterranean Sea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Were demand ever to rise high enough, we would most likely be able to acquire far more than enough of any natural resource on Earth through further surveying and capital investment, at a far smaller cost than would be needed to acquire it in space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a cosmic perspective, this is perhaps unsurprising. In the Earth’s crust, there are about 3.4 billion metric tons of matter for every living person. Even abundant energy is currently achievable here on Earth, such as through </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-state-of-the-us-nuclear-industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The effectiveness of nuclear fission also weakens the appeal of, say, mining the Moon for helium-3 to power </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/fusion-power-cannot-count-on-governments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion reactors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All such economic justifications for space exploration then amount to creating a limitless supply for which there is no demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could exist a civilization with such vast demands for matter and energy that space exploration becomes economically attractive through simple Malthusian logic. But this is not our civilization, nor is there any reason to think it will be in the future without deliberate and extensive social, political, cultural, and institutional re-engineering. Our civilization has abundant minerals and energy within its grasp right here on Earth but has no use for them. There is no reason to think space resources are different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from resource extraction, there are plausible economic reasons for activity in or near the Earth&#8217;s orbit, such as operating satellites. But the hard part is justifying activity in space that isn&#8217;t self-justifying due to its proximity to all the good stuff on Earth. An obvious proposal is space tourism. Done right, an orbital habitat could blow Dubai or Singapore out of the water as a luxury destination. Once it became old hat, you could build small luxury destinations on or around the Moon, Mars, and further beyond. This would create the demand for other space activity and infrastructure, like better rockets, life support systems, and space mining. It could also be a profitable motive for a private company, even under conditions of industrial and demographic decline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only question is if there is really enough demand for space tourism to pay the cost of creating the supply. Building even the initial infrastructure for such tourism could be beyond the ability of any private company. Our first steps into space have already been monumentally expensive. From 1959 to 1972, NASA </span><a href="https://christopherrcooper.com/apollo-program-cost-return-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 2.2 percent of U.S. federal expenditure. Wernher von Braun was working with today’s equivalent of roughly a $138 billion annual budget to get us to the Moon, ultimately successfully. For comparison, NASA’s annual budget today is about $25 billion, only one-fifth of this. The recent Artemis program to return to the Moon will likely cost over $100 billion in total. The International Space Station is sometimes called the single most expensive man-made object ever created, at an </span><a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/the-most-expensive-thing-ever-made-by-humans-a-tech-marvel-cost-a-whopping-100-billion-71663669633972.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $150 billion or more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These costs, measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars, are comparable only to a few spending programs like social security ($1.2 trillion) or the U.S. military ($751 billion). Needless to say, these are government programs. The only companies with annual profits </span><a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/most-profitable-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than $100 billion are Apple and Saudi Aramco. SpaceX, the premier institution leading humanity to space right now, has a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">total</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> valuation that is only $137 billion. The costs of space activity can be brought down significantly through technological innovation, private management, and economies of scale, as SpaceX itself has shown by reducing the price per mass of launches to orbit. But this has been done largely in the context of being a government contractor to NASA. Outside of satellites, effectively the entire space industry </span><a href="https://research.contrary.com/reports/spacex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on government funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no surprise then that a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of space tourism and asteroid mining companies have been founded and have failed, though this probably speaks more to the blind enthusiasm for space than its actual economics. It is also possible that tourism is inherently only a follow-on industry that takes advantage of capital investments and R&amp;D made by other institutions with more willingness and ability to successfully invest in expensive, long-term projects—like governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments can justify effectively unlimited funds for space exploration on the basis of increasing military power, as happened in the original Space Race. It always makes military sense to have communications and surveillance satellites, or perhaps spaceborne missile silos, that are a little bit farther away and a little bit harder to detect, obstruct, or destroy by an enemy. This can eventually justify the economic infrastructure to maintain and develop such military space systems, which might include Moon or Mars colonies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a military motivation puts space progress entirely at the whims of terrestrial geopolitics. When geopolitical tensions cool down, space is the first program to have its funding cut. This is exactly what happened from the 1970s until the 2010s, when Cold War détente, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and then the hope of peaceful globalization resulted in space progress not only stopping but sometimes reversing. As of 2023, it looks like the U.S. government has once again decided to support space exploration: NASA has tapped Lockheed Martin for </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/nasa-darpa-lockheed-martin-nuclear-propulsion-demo-1850682737"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear propulsion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while Elon Musk defies gravity as a major government contractor who publicly criticizes U.S. foreign policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no coincidence that this shift happened at the same time that the U.S. government collectively decided that China was no longer just a far-off trade partner, but a geopolitical and ideological rival to the United States. The U.S. Space Force, and the Artemis program to return to the Moon, were launched by President Donald Trump, whose unprecedented hawkishness on China was quietly adopted by Washington and continued after he left office. At the same time, </span><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-long-march-into-space"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s space program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has launched its own space station in Earth orbit, landed a rover on Mars, and is planning not only to land men on the Moon but to build a permanent Moon base. There is little doubt they will eventually succeed. The Chinese space program, even if it were entirely civilian, threatens the prestige of the U.S. as the leading superpower, so it cannot go unchallenged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But advocates of space exploration should not celebrate this turn of events too enthusiastically. Once again, space progress is being adopted instrumentally for geopolitical reasons, not on its own merits. The U.S. and China are increasingly on a trajectory for military conflict; perhaps over Taiwan, perhaps over something else. Were a war to occur, the victor would almost certainly lose all interest in expensive space investments all over again. In our own lifetimes, we might live to see permanent Moon bases—and then permanently abandoned Moon bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is no political justification for interplanetary activity, in the sense of leaving Earth for a new life on Mars free from the interference of Earthly mores, laws, and governments. The pressures and dangers of life in artificial habitats, whether on a planet or in orbit, will necessitate strict protocols for behavior, which will be enforced through pervasive surveillance. The systems used to enforce discipline will just as easily be used to enforce political discipline. All such systems will be ultimately controlled from Earth, first because they will be instituted under organizations based on and beholden to Earth, and later because Earth missiles fly fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political independence is actually achieved either past interstellar distances, or by pulling off a truly self-sustaining colony right before a catastrophic decline in Earth civilization that renders it unable to maintain interplanetary missiles. This could be engineered—that is to say, an armed space colony could acquire and preemptively use catastrophic weapons on Earth. But this means that, fittingly for the planet of the God of War, there are no libertarian motives for emigrating to Mars, only militarist ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engineering and logistics breakthroughs that would be made through a large-scale interplanetary expansion are almost certainly a prerequisite for interstellar travel. In practice, these have only been led by governments or government contractors, because there is in fact no good economic justification for large-scale expansion of human activity in interplanetary space, and governments have only made these vast investments for instrumental and extremely unreliable geopolitical or military reasons, which are incompatible with the continuous and generational work that would be necessary for a multi-planetary civilization. In the end, the only pure and reliable justification for interplanetary expansion is its potential to transform human civilization, in particular as the launchpad for interstellar exploration and expansion, but this is precisely the justification that governments have never adopted.</span></p>
<h3><b>Don’t Panic</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project of interstellar civilization may seem incomprehensibly vast, beyond the ability of anyone to influence. But it is not inevitable. Like any great work, it will only occur through planned and deliberate human action. Given the scale of distances involved, we will need to carry out the work not only with unprecedented ingenuity and mobilization of people and resources, but generational continuity of mission and succession. This will need to be done without the expectation of economic profit or military advantage. There are in fact many precedents for such projects in history, but only carried out successfully by two kinds of institutions, usually working together: governments and religions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all recorded history, states have basically only acted on three motivations: national security, economic growth, and political legitimacy. The first two are unreliable or incoherent for interstellar civilization. The third, however, fits like a charm. Legitimacy is as vital to states as economic or military security. As a result, states have spent immeasurable quantities of resources, for decades and even centuries, on projects that, at first glance, seem to have had no material purpose or value. Think of the bronze </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/10/how-late-zhou-china-reverse-engineered-a-civilization/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ding</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of ancient China, the ziggurats of Sumer, or the cathedrals of medieval Europe. These projects were not in fact useless but fulfilled the need for legitimacy according to the beliefs, values, and tastes of the peoples who built them. In that sense, they were priceless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion of human civilization to other stars will not be pioneered by lone adventurers or merry bands of hardy explorers, like we imagine the voyages of Erik the Red or Christopher Columbus. This works for interplanetary space, but not interstellar space, whose travel time will require multiple generations of people to survive a journey, including on the first try. Interstellar travel will need to accommodate not just adventurous young men with nothing to lose, but also women, children, and the elderly. In other words, a whole society. The existence of a society always implies the existence of a government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, the sociological challenge of persuading a whole society to migrate into the unknown is very different from that of an explorer&#8217;s mission, which needs only the promise of adventure. Like the ancient Israelites, the Pilgrims, or the Mormons, a great migration will only occur when a Promised Land has been credibly found. Indirect evidence of extrasolar planets will never be enough. Whether with colossal space telescopes or ultra-fast nano-probes armed with cameras, we will need to have beautiful images and real maps of alien worlds before human civilization can become interstellar. The purpose of interplanetary expansion is to build the infrastructure and technology to make such scopes and probes feasible. These will be our cathedrals, the legacy which we will leave to our descendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern governments are often wrongly derided for lacking vision. In fact, they are already committed to multi-trillion-dollar, multi-decade-long visions that require all of society, technology, and world geopolitics to be back-engineered accordingly. The U.S. government, for example, </span><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/budget_function"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spends half its budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social welfare programs, especially for the elderly. We take for granted that this is unremarkable, when in fact it is extremely historically unusual and a reflection of our deep commitment to a certain kind of post-industrial society that existentially values comfort and individuality. There is no economic or military benefit to social security, but the U.S. government will use the full force of the U.S. economy and military to defend the system that maintains it. Other goals are possible too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than a government or religion, perhaps a new kind of institution yet to be invented will be able to take humanity to the stars. But such an institution would need to be capable of organizing people, spending resources, and maintaining its mission on a scale that would rival even the governments of the U.S. or China today. Family dynasties might offer a useful model here. But there is functionally no path to such a powerful institution peacefully coexisting with today’s governments, so it would require a civilization that is orders of magnitude more industrially, demographically, and technologically advanced, where a government that can spend the equivalent of hundreds of trillions can coexist with private institutions that can spend mere trillions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also possible that only a society that treats the pursuit of interstellar civilization as its central legitimating project, from which the legitimacy of all other institutions and ideas is derived, will ever succeed at actually building it. To advocate for space exploration on the back of instrumental economic or military justifications is ultimately more like a trick or a hack than an honest and sustainable long-term position. There is no reason to omit the potential of space to transform humanity for the better, which is ultimately the core and only durable reason to aim for interstellar civilization. Whatever may be out there, however it may change us—there is a golden path to a destiny among the stars. Isn’t it worth following?</span></p>

</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a round of introductions at a recent dinner party, we were polled for takes on the subject of artificial intelligence. Some attendees were researchers, some were company founders or investors, and others worked at think tanks or as commentators. They were all optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answers ranged from enthusiasm about new technology, to excitement at how many people’s ambitions it would enable, to resentment against the people trying to regulate their work. When my turn came, I realized with horror that even my considered opinion was going to be a rather hot take in this company. I tried to soften the blow:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI is a very promising technological program that will probably kill us all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interjections and quips around the table confirmed the heat. “Oh no, Wolf, I didn’t know you were a doomer!” exclaimed the jolly executive beside me. I replied that I was not necessarily a doomer, and told him I would explain over dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point in the discussion, the question came up of whether a much more advanced artificial intelligence could escape the control of its creators and become an existential challenger to humankind. One attendee claimed that no such thing could ever happen because a machine was just a tool. Humans would always hold the decisive power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked what I believe to be the crucial question: “What if you get into a fight with your AI tool? If a program is actually intelligent, especially in a way superior to humans, you might have to fight a war against it to shut it down, and you might not be able to win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at me like I had asked about going to war against an ordinary garden rake. “That’s impossible. Only humans can have that kind of agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found this attitude puzzling, especially from someone who has spent much of his career fighting with software, and who seemed to take the premise of advanced artificial intelligence seriously. To be honest, I was stumped. But his attitude is not unreasonable. To definitively defend or refute any position on the subject is a tangled mess because the whole conversation is so speculative. No one has built a real artificial intelligence superior to humans or demonstrated a robust scientific theory of it, so it is hard to ground one’s predictions in much more than speculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For seven decades now, the goal of the artificial intelligence field has been to produce computer programs capable of every cognitive task that humans can do, including open-ended research that is inclusive of AI itself, and creative, high-agency action in the world. The latest developments in deep learning and transformers have been impressive, to say the least. But these results are not enough to prove much about the possibility of the larger goals, about the essential nature of AI, its implications, or what we should be doing about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first got deep into the subject of advanced artificial intelligence back in 2011. Before </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AlexNET</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and GPU-based deep learning, AI was a much more niche subject, but the conversation had been going on for decades. The discourse was composed of science fiction fans, transhumanists, and mostly sober algorithms researchers. All were chasing this holy grail of the computer revolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their built-up canon of explicit arguments and less-articulated speculations have had an immense influence on the present discourse. However, the hype, memes, and politics around AI since deep learning have obscured the original kernels of careful thought, making it hard to have a productive conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the many discussions I’ve had with friends, acquaintances, and experts on the subject, it has become clear to me that very few of the essential ideas about AI are commonly understood or even well-articulated. It is understandable that the critics and disbelievers of the idea are not familiar with the best arguments of its devotees—or don’t bother to distinguish them from the half-baked science fiction ideology that exists alongside them. You can’t be an expert in every branch of kookery you reject. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even among the most fervent “believers” in artificial intelligence, and among its most sophisticated critics, there is little shared consensus on key assumptions, arguments, or implications. They all have their own incompatible paradigms of careful thought, and they can’t all be right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These fits and starts are all to be expected of what is currently an early-stage scientific and engineering paradigm that has not yet achieved its key results. The promising frontiers beyond established science and engineering are almost always filled with unclear assumptions, strange ideologies, and even new theology. Newton had alchemy and non-Trinitarian Christianity, Tsiolkovsky was motivated by the Russian neo-theology of Cosmism, and Jack Parsons pursued a variety of occult experiments with the likes of Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard. But this is not necessarily a bad thing at this stage. It may even be necessary. New paradigms in science have always come from kooks on the fringe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the field of AI has built up some very solid core arguments besides the hype and kookery. If you are going to engage with AI as anything more than cutting-edge software or a genre of tech hype, you must have a solid understanding of these arguments. It’s important not to get lost in the nonsense or dismiss it altogether, because if real AI does pan out the result will be a technological phase shift the likes of which have not been seen in human history—with the possible exception of language itself. It will break many current foundational assumptions about what technology can and cannot do, the human condition, and what destiny we are headed toward. We cannot understand AI without grappling with those deeper questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Field Seeks Artificial General Intelligence</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interesting kind of artificial intelligence is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Short of that crucial generality, “AI” amounts to “software.” We have lots of software. It is both useful and dangerous. It has transformed our world for both better and worse and will continue to do so. But whatever we have done with software, it all still relies on us. If our culture collapsed, so would our software stack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AGI is an interesting idea because it challenges the paradigm of “just software.” Instead, an AGI system would in theory be able to act as a natural agent in the world. Rather than rely on human owners and programmers, AGI would be able to develop its own view of the world, act without a human in the loop, reprogram itself, and make plans to achieve its own goals. It could even recognize adversaries to those goals and defend itself from them. This could go as far as staffing and defending an entire robotic industrial stack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defined as such, AGI would not be just software. In particular, the ability to set itself against adversaries implies the capability to protect itself against attempts to control it or shut it down. If it were to ever identify its programmers, owners, or entire host civilizations as adversaries, an AGI system’s existence could become self-enforcing. Your garden rake can’t do that, and ChatGPT isn’t much closer—both are just tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theoretical field of artificial intelligence kicked off in 1956, with the famous Dartmouth Workshop. Organizer and computer scientist John McCarthy </span><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the central conjecture of AI:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Dartmouth and in the discussions that followed the conference, the founders set goals for the nascent field. These included reproducing the full spectrum of human cognitive capacities, such as learning from data and experience, understanding the world through senses like vision, reasoning about knowledge and reality, talking to humans, beating humans at games of strategy and operation planning, writing computer programs, planning out actions to accomplish goals, and taking autonomous action in the world. The implied reasoning was that for a computer system to have general intelligence and full agency—a practical AGI—it would need to have most, if not all of these capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, general intelligence is not reducible to any list of narrow sensory, motor, and cognitive modalities. All of those capabilities have now been demonstrated on their own, but they do not amount to general intelligence just by being cobbled together. One computer program can learn chess statistics from data, another can plan how to beat you at chess, and another can answer your natural language questions about the history of chess. But no computer program can yet tell you what it learned from direct experience over the last week, or decide not to tell you because your knowledge would interfere with its future plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the field lacks a concrete theory of general intelligence, it is hard to say exactly what is still missing. However, it is something to do with having an expressive framework for its internal body of knowledge that can simultaneously understand, learn about, plan, and control its environment. It would act as a common language to integrate these multiple modalities together as tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This algorithm or set of algorithms remains elusive, but researchers in the field have made progress. In 2005, five self-driving cars completed the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_(2005)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DARPA Grand Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive autonomously for over 130 miles in the desert. These vehicles had to integrate many key capabilities: vision and other sensor processing, planning, maintaining a probabilistic worldview, and decision-making under uncertainty. The key advance was the </span><a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/thrun.stanley05.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these capabilities and the fusion of sensor data streams around a single probabilistic worldview so that everything spoke the same language and could collaborate smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an incremental advance towards actual general intelligence. However, all the algorithms and the internal ontology itself were narrow and hand-programmed rather than learned in some general-purpose way. The program was not capable of significant learning, let alone changing its own ontology. It could only act and adapt in well-defined ways, and could only handle a single task; driving a car in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current advances remain in this vein. Most researchers in the field do not even necessarily take AGI to be their goal. They are just working on narrow cognitive capabilities which can save human labor through software. But AGI is the biggest goal of the field, and the telos around which the other goals are organized and toward which they lead.</span></p>
<h3><b>General Intelligence Is Probably Real and Computable</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elusiveness of general intelligence theories and algorithms raises the question of whether such a thing is even possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In humans, we see a remarkable ability to dive into any environment, navigate it, identify problems, learn and strategize about them, do whatever tasks and planning are necessary to solve them, and through this generally continue to build up power in that environment such that they can achieve their goals in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to beavers or ants, this ability in humans is much more general purpose; a human being can master all kinds of problems and ways of living in a very wide range of novel social and physical environments. For example, humans have mastered everything from metallurgy and farming to military strategy and industrial production. Some animals, like crows, also exhibit remarkable flexibility in being able to learn and invent new techniques to master new opportunities, but not to the same degree as humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ability also varies between humans. We observe that some people are smart and others are dull. We can even roughly measure it with IQ tests and we distinguish intelligence from mere knowledge. We know that it is a bad idea to rely on smart people not being able to eventually figure something out. We know that if we need something figured out and mastered, we can throw smart people at it and have a good chance of getting it done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept is not limited to our own modern culture: words like “wit” are very ancient. Mythic heroes like Odysseus were praised for being clever. Intelligence is a distinct concept throughout recorded history. What is unique to our own culture, and more specifically to the budding branch of it that believes AGI is possible, is John McCarthy’s conjecture: that general intelligence, like flight, arithmetic, and fire, is a mechanistic phenomenon that can be mastered through science and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without any special insight into the problem, we can see that many once-mysterious things have been so mastered by science and engineering that we now take them for granted as part of our daily infrastructure, like communications via artificial heavenly bodies. Our knowledge of other phenomena like psychology remains essentially non-scientific despite attempts to make it so, but this is not too surprising. Psychology is partially a derivative phenomenon of intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engineering sciences have likewise made progress on many problems related to general intelligence. For example, information theory scientifically formalizes the concept of information itself. Computer control of robotic systems makes it possible for computer programs to act in the world. Various narrow AI algorithms solve decision and optimization problems formerly reserved for humans. In particular, deep learning has shown remarkable generality in being able to learn nearly any practical function from example data. While there are few definitive results, neuroscience continues to improve its models of what neurons, the brain, and the other more distributed cognition systems in the body actually do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of more direct insights, the AI field has attempted to formalize the concept of general intelligence in various plausible ways. We could think of it as minimizing an abstract free energy over a representation of perceptions, expectations, ideas, goals, and memories. We could think of it as the degree to which a controller hooked up to an interactive environment can cause that environment to settle into arbitrarily-defined “desirable” states. We could specify it in the limit as running a set of output-conditioned predictive Turing machines, selecting only those consistent with observation, and then outputting whatever that ensemble predicts would maximize the expected reward, as in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIXI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We can modify, normalize, and relax these definitions by various schemes. These are all incomplete or inadequate in some way, but they gesture in the right direction. Some of them are likely to be computable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most famous non-computable problems—like the halting problem, non-computable numbers, and the Kolmogorov complexity of a given string—face paradoxes in the self-contradictory, infinite, or recursive nature of their subjects and in the logical strictness of the required answer. Many formalizations of intelligence have this problem as well and are therefore uncomputable. However, if we relax them to allow approximation, on-average correctness, and best-effort optimization, they are essentially normal problems without expected computability issues and for which practical algorithms probably exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural intelligence is already a bit stochastic, best-effort, and useful-on-average rather than exactly correct in output. Optimality in all possible environments is almost certainly uncomputable, but an algorithm does not need to be perfectly optimal to do better than current state-of-the-art intelligence: human agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real problem of AGI feasibility is philosophical: restating McCarthy’s conjecture, can we untangle what we mean by intelligence enough to build an algorithm for it? Judging by the practical and cross-cultural robustness of the concept, we probably can. We just don’t know how yet.</span></p>
<h3><b>Modern Engineering Can Build AGI</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sunken ship from ancient Greece, divers dredged up a complex assembly of corroded gears and wheels that computed the positions of the planets. Dubbed the Antikythera mechanism, this artifact was evidence not just of one skilled craftsman but of a whole science and proto-industry advanced beyond anything previously understood. In particular, it was evidence of some understanding of the idea of mechanical calculation. Archimedes himself, or some other scientist of the time, may have dreamed of using these principles of clockwork computation to build a mind. Perhaps they would have been inspired by the god Hephaestus’s golden robotic serving girls from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iliad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if they did dream of it, their engineering wasn’t ready. They didn’t have powerful enough computers. Furthermore, they probably did not have the calculus, information theory, probability theory, computer science, and the other still-unknown parts of mathematics and philosophy necessary to even design such a thing. There may likewise be some crucial faculty we are missing that would prevent us from building AGI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we have many things the ancients didn’t have, which suggests that we are very close in most of the key engineering capacities. Engineers in the twenty-first century have built computer-controlled robots that walk around, dance, talk, hear and follow commands, and see the world around them. Many factories have significant robotic automation already, limited mostly by the lack of intelligence of the machines. We have a basic understanding of how the brain&#8217;s neurons act as computational elements, how much computation they do, and how many of them there are. By some estimates, we are now crossing the threshold where a human brain&#8217;s worth of computation is available off the shelf. We have a whole industry of people who can build computer programs to implement whatever algorithmic principle we can discover. The major missing piece is the key ideas of artificial general intelligence themselves. Given those ideas, the engineering side seems poised to put them into action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we grant the AI field’s major conjecture—that general intelligence can be specified to the point that practical algorithms can be written to implement it—there are several different paradigms of how to even do this. “Good old fashioned AI” (GOFAI) attempts to build a system that symbolically reasons from evidence, assumptions, knowledge, heuristics, and goals to plans and actions. “Connectionist” AI, based on neural nets, dispenses with symbolic abstraction and deals directly with complex but low-level black-box calculations of perception and reflexive response. We can also imagine a “genetic” approach that evolves a complex ecosystem of interacting sub-processes selected by some overall logic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the approaches conceived so far, and there may well be others. Within each individual paradigm, there are a dozen or more different parameters. What kinds of assumptions and heuristics? What kind of logic system? How precise versus approximate? What kind of neural architectures? How are they trained? Is training distinct from “inference?” What kind of subprocesses? Do we need a combination of these approaches? And so on it goes. We have a wealth of threads to pull on, and any one of them could yield the key insights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent wave of progress in deep learning resulted from the unexpected effectiveness of applying GPU acceleration to back-propagation-based training ideas invented in the late 1980s. In between then, neural nets had mostly stagnated as an approach. Where deep learning goes next, and if it goes anywhere novel at all, is hard to know. The next major breakthrough could be another deep learning architecture like the &#8220;attention&#8221;-based transformer, but it could also come from somewhere else entirely. Perhaps some breakthrough in proof theory or symbol learning could suddenly make GOFAI viable the way deep learning suddenly made neural nets viable. Or the field could stagnate for another 20 years. Further progress may depend on some new branch of mathematics developed by an unrelated neo-Pythagorean cult. The whole thing may even depend on new philosophy or theology. It may be that no one currently working on these problems has the right mix of obscure skills and knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it may also be that we are very close, and the right person working in their basement could publish a working AGI architecture tomorrow. Many of the details of AGI are unknown unknowns, which are impossible to predict. Discussions about “AI timelines” are therefore not well-grounded. But we can say with significant confidence that AGI is possible and that twenty-first-century engineering is ready to put it into practice if the scientific and philosophical breakthroughs come through.</span></p>
<h3><b>AGI Threatens Humankind’s Niche</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big implications of AGI start with the fact that it implies the possibility of fully autonomous robotized industrial ecosystems that don’t require any human oversight or labor. With only modest extrapolations of today’s industrial technology, AGI systems could design, run, and manage a closed loop of robotic workers to staff mines and factories and manufacture all their own industrial components. Imagine relatively cheap AGI-controlled robots driving existing industrial equipment. Many industries already focus human labor on tasks weighted toward judgment, creativity, and flexibility. With AGI, these constraints go away: industrial computer systems become capable of creative oversight and business strategy, and highly flexible general-purpose industrial robots become much more viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the potential profits, this kind of robotization may occur with enthusiastic human help. Some aspects of industrial labor and management may be beyond first-generation AGI robotics. However, the combined human-AGI industrial ecosystem will have a strong incentive to improve designs and build next-generation products that are more capable. Given the industrial scaling and improvement properties of computers, and the greater degree of optimization that can be applied to artificial intelligence, this could lead to a “superintelligence” capability that could replace all human labor in the entire industrial ecosystem and outsmart any human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the limit of this process, the only remaining roles for humans would be non-productive ones like legal responsibility, ownership, taxation, entitlements, and roles kept to humans for customary reasons. This regime of non-productive human benefit would either be held up by some real power advantage humans retain over AGI, or by the hardcoded will of the AGI systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter scheme goes by the name of “AI alignment.” The idea is that if we turn over actual control of the means of production to some AGI system, we had better be very sure that it loves us, wants the best for us, and will do what we actually want and not just what we say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For simple AGI systems with narrow goals and less-than-human intelligence, this will be straightforward. Some level of control is necessary for usefulness, and iterating to make systems safer and more controllable after every failure is the norm in engineering. However, that normal iterative process depends on the ability to turn a failed system off, clean up the damage, and start over. You can only do that if it isn’t smarter than you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that in an AGI alignment accident, the AI doesn’t just become a pile of rubble. Rather, it becomes an active and potentially hostile free agent that may vigorously defend itself. If it’s much smarter than you and gets control of your safety backup systems, you may not be able to win that fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more worrying, the difficulty of specifying a safe goal or incentive system appears to scale with the intelligence of the agent. The more intelligent it is, the more unforeseen and undesirable ways it can find to fulfill its given goals. Because of this, superintelligence is dangerous in two different ways: it makes an iterative safety engineering process difficult or impossible because failures become existential, and the difficulty of the safety problem itself scales with intelligence. Attempts by theorists to get around this with various schemes have so far been fruitless. Alignment of superintelligence may just be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is another more material way that alignment may be impossible: a fully automated industrial ecosystem does not need to maintain environmental conditions compatible with human life. As long as it can control its internal factory environments, external pollution doesn’t matter. An automated industry of this sort would be freed from any constraint around human survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former scheme for human benefit—an imposed settlement where AGI becomes an electric slave class—has the same problems. Political settlements are only as strong as your own ability to put down rebellions. Some imagine that a human principal can control its superintelligent agents with other superintelligent agents, but this is only the famously precarious position of relying on mercenaries for fundamental security. At some point, the mercenaries realize that they are the ones who hold the decisive power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even without a direct rebellion, vestigial classes without the power to enforce their position always get phased out over time. A serious war makes this acute, with an immense pressure to cut fat and promote the subsystems actually doing the work, but it will happen regardless. For example, the mass mobilization bureaucracies that were crucial to winning the world wars became the new regimes afterwards, regardless of which side nominally won. In a future AGI-enhanced war, the result will be AGI regimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power follows substance. The only secure positions are those based on a strong material advantage in decisive capabilities. The current niche that humans thrive in is the niche of organized general intelligence. If AGI systems become practically superior to humans in that niche, the inevitable result is the replacement of humans by AGI. Given advanced AGI, human beings become an expensive and doomed vestigial class, destined for liquidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This could all play out slowly or quickly. It is not dependent on any element of surprise, reaction time, or the sudden appearance of unknown technologies apart from AGI itself. The result is only dependent on the relative balance of capabilities. The deployment of advanced AGI makes it impossible to avoid the obsolescence and probable extinction of humankind under any reasonable set of assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practice, it could be very fast. One major unknown factor is the rate of recursive self-improvement of an AGI-autonomous industrial ecosystem. Once the intelligence designing and improving the industrial stack is an engineered product of that stack itself, every increment in capability results in a greater ability to make improvements. The only fundamental limit to this is running out of clever improvements to make, which may be very far from where we are now. The industrial revolution was extremely quick by historical standards and produced a world-changing jump in capability. With artificial engineers designing even better artificial engineers, recursive self-improvement could unlock far higher levels of capability even more quickly, leading to the sudden obsolescence and extinction of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scenario depends on a number of unpredictable and unknown advances coming to pass, and as such it is not guaranteed. Speculations can always be missing some crucial consideration. But that is not controllable, and not something to rely on. In particular, I have seen no plausible rebuttal to this picture on any of the above points. The AGI future is speculation, but in the absence of strong epistemic or political challenge it is becoming an increasingly dominant and likely paradigm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t like the implications of AGI, there is at least one controllable factor: as long as the AI industry remains committed to accelerating down the path to human obsolescence, and as long as the political regime continues to allow it, AGI and subsequent human extinction remain a live possibility. There are alternatives, but they will not happen by default. That leaves you with a hard political choice: Do you want to replace humanity with AGI, or do you want to stop it so that humanity can survive? </span></p>

The post <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/08/03/you-cant-trust-the-ai-hype/">You Can’t Trust the <b>AI</b> Hype
</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend had recently gained a renewed appreciation for managing people instead of software. “Why build tech when we have interns?” he asked as we caught up. He had recently made an exit from a successful startup and was now applying his AI skills in a large non-tech industry. “I had an intern manually watch a bunch of footage today and label stuff, and called it AI. If our stakeholders really like it, then we can build the tech later.” It was an offhand comment, but it got me thinking: just how much of tech proper was doing the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might interpret this kind of move as mere technological laziness in an established industry, but you would be wrong. My friend faithfully applied a strategy used by countless AI-branded companies around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google was able to market its Duplex service as a personal AI tool even while it required human assistance in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/technology/personaltech/ai-google-duplex.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its calls a year after launch: 25 percent of the calls began with a human and 15 percent of the rest required intervention at some point. 60 percent of calls done entirely by AI is still impressive, but the accurate branding would be something far more like a hybrid outsourcing service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the pond, one French founder quipped that “</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951720919776"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madagascar is the leader in French artificial intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” since the AI-branded startups in his country tend to outsource their hidden human labor there. Other examples are legion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern reveals something quite strange about not just AI, but the broader tech industry too: being “in tech” or “in AI” describes branding and a particular social sphere as much as anything to do with how the work is done. You operate in the world of VCs and startup CEOs, use a geometric sans-serif logo, and are on Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has only intensified this trait—in fact, you might not have to create anything related to deep learning at all. Companies can present as if they are “AI companies” while using no machine learning—up to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2019/03/04/nearly-half-of-all-ai-startups-are-cashing-in-on-hype/?sh=5f31a290d022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of AI companies in Europe alone do it—and still reap the benefits of higher funding and excitement. The supermarkets and HVAC companies trying to posture as “technology leaders” by </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/stock-market-outlook-artificial-intelligence-ai-investing-plays-wall-street-picks.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AI strategies into investor reports are on even more dubious ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason this works is hype. AI is the future, the future is now, and looking too closely at the details could mean losing the bag. What makes AI interesting is that, unlike cryptocurrency or the early internet, it all somehow feels expected. AI is unmatched in how long-standing and ready-made the narrative of its own inevitability is, and the sense most people have that they understand its essence even if they can’t quite describe the technical guts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consequentially, fully-developed AI is supposed to ultimately replace humans, both in specific domains of work and perhaps even as Earth’s apex life form—everybody “knows” that, somehow. From the perspective of this expectation, a tool that requires extensive human support is therefore early-stage at best and a failure at worst. In this setting, AI becomes something like a genre and a narrative de-linked from the capabilities of specific tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That narrative reflects a deeply held belief within tech itself: that the most significant problems are engineering problems, and more specifically technology problems. This is an attitude sometimes criticized as “</span><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/evgeny-morozov/to-save-everything-click-here/9781610393706/?lens=publicaffairs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solutionism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This attitude is useful when it sees material potential where others may not, as with the early internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But can also lead to destructive overfitting. Elon Musk famously overestimated the capabilities of the automated robotics systems Tesla attempted to base its factory on, which </span><a href="https://qz.com/1261214/how-exactly%20tesla-shot-itself-in-the-foot-by-trying-to-hyper-automate-its-factory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couldn’t adequately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> handle many judgment-laden details like the fine-tuned corrections of screws, bolts, and fasteners that humans did naturally.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over-automation created </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robots-are-killing-it-2018-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disruptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in welding, battery pack assembly, and final assembly of vehicles. The whole thing left Tesla with a hefty redesign cost and Musk updated to a more human-centric view of how to make cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the degree that any problem is an engineering or technology problem, the tech industry gains an immediate advantage in solving it. If it’s a software or computer science problem, that advantage often becomes a monopoly. The incentive of the tech industry, then, is to convince people that all significant problems are engineering problems, narrowly defined as those categories of engineering at which the tech industry does best. By acting as an epistemic cartel in this way, the industry pumps up the value of its work and guarantees its future capital flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ideological hype is the stuff from which bubbles are made. But an AI bubble in deep learning won’t kill off the underlying technology, just as the dot com bubble didn’t kill off the internet. What matters more is that people are making decisions about technologies and their potential in an epistemic environment dominated by a hype narrative. That has blown up the share prices of AI-branded companies, but the scrambling of market signals also incurs huge opportunity costs on the level of both companies and the larger economy. Musk’s bet that </span><a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-confirms-he-has-fired-over-80-of-twitter-employees-so-far-377045-2023-04-12#:~:text=Now%2C%20Twitter%20is%20left%20with%20around%201%2C500%20employees.&amp;text=Elon%20Musk%20has%20confirmed%20that,after%20the%20%2444%20billion%2Dtakeover."><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Twitter could be fired without doing any real harm to the app itself seems to have paid off. The extremely high “tech” valuation of Twitter overfunded it to the point that it could get away with hiring five times too many people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This colors how people understand the capabilities, function, and purpose of AI technologies. From the level of ordinary workers all the way to prominent founders, people are operating on ideology—either naively or cynically—instead of on the rigorous assessment of tools. When most beliefs and even market signals reflect ideological hype-mongering, you can no longer trust them as guides to the value of these tools or of their long-run technical potential. What they signal is successful large-scale conditioning into the tech industry’s preferred narratives about AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any accurate assessment of the potential of deep learning tools requires a rigorous exclusion of hype narratives that is nearly impossible to achieve on the individual level. Investor bubbles may come and go, and while they attract retrospective criticism, they are a passing problem. The large-scale misallocation of resources, on the other hand, incurs compounding opportunity costs on a massive scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its worst, such ideological hype causes a systematic over-investment in new technologies that do not actually yield much overall progress or development across society. Bubble-driven investment incurs large economic costs. Pursued in this way, AI may actually be an economic and industrial net negative. Misallocations can continue for generations, free-riding off the functional parts of the structure while the overall reality is one of decay and dissolution.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Tech Industry&#8217;s High-Yield Ideology</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tool is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">what it does. Its nature is not determined by what people imagine it can do, think it should</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">do, or even what its inventors originally intended it to do. Alfred Nobel first invented dynamite for use in mining, but its actual nature as an explosive made it useful in war. When its inherent capabilities are applied within some process or system, the tool gains a function within that system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the technology is new and the set of possible functions is large, figuring out how to implement such tools usefully is highly dependent on the worldview of the planner. What makes AI unique is the degree to which tech ideology and even science fiction inform that worldview across large swathes of society. Decades of storytelling about superior machine minds have primed society into a simple narrative: computers are smarter than you, lack your weaknesses, and will replace you in all tasks that matter as soon as the computing power involved gets strong enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the ultimate in tech ideological cartel thinking. In the solutionist apocalypse, frail and fallible mankind is the most fundamental problem and AI will eventually solve it once we hit artificial general intelligence. Whether this is utopian or extinctionist is a matter of taste. That the underlying technology has changed several times—Japan’s distributed computing systems did not pan out in the 1980s—has never led to wavering in the basic story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intensity of tech ideology gets higher the closer you get to the tech industry itself, and specifically the closer you get to Silicon Valley. IBM is also a tech company, but an older New York tech company rather than a newer Silicon Valley one. That distance matters and the resulting tone is very different. In its public </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/GVAGA3JP"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, IBM tends toward empiricism, dryly giving the numbers on who is using what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other distinct AI ecosystems also exist. Each tends to see AI as an issue through the lens of its own concerns and methods, and in a way that implies an expansion of its own power. In Washington D.C., AI tends to be a security question befitting the needs of the security and government complex. In China, AI ends up being part of the Communist Party’s </span><a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/17/the-genealogy-of-chinese-cybernetics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at constructing a population monitoring apparatus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each ecosystem is colored by the lens of those interests that make it up, and they all interact with each other to varying degrees. But the Silicon Valley ecosystem is unquestionably upstream of the rest; it is the hub of much of the advanced technical research and the place where the ideologies and philosophies around AI are at their most explicit, radical, and consciously promoted. It is where you will have long discussions about just how we might cross the line into agentic artificial general intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day-to-day ideological promotion tends to happen at the hands of VC funds, startup CEOs, and the like. Recently, a16z cofounder Marc Andreessen and YCombinator president Garry Tan have both pushed “e/acc” (effective accelerationism) to hype young entrepreneurs into entering the AI world and VC term sheets, playing on a defanged iteration of the “accelerationist” ideas of philosopher Nick Land. A few years ago, a16z benefited from the boosting of “web3,” a meme with a similar hyping function for cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Players like this receive the direct payoffs of tech ideology, both in AI and other fields. They directly benefit by shifting attention to their preferred problems and their preferred solutions for them. VC funds hype young entrepreneurs into creating startups that they become good at evaluating for potential success. If an industry is successful, they end up with stakes and influence over its leading firms. Those who run and own the startups themselves, meanwhile, benefit from later-stage investors operating on the same hype and from convincing clients of the necessity of adopting their product. A startup that taps effectively into society-wide hype is a startup that can rapidly increase its valuation and then pass the bag to less sophisticated investors. The tech ideology gets skin in the game.</span></p>
<h3><b>AI’s Hidden Human Hands</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley is also a hub for more explicit and developed philosophies of AI. Even top AI pioneers interact with these ideas, ranging from the Kurzweilian Singularity to Yudkowsky’s </span><a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to halt all AI development to the point of air strikes on rogue data centers. It’s where people are confident that minds are fundamentally mechanical and thus engineerable, that an eventual hard trade-off between AI and human dominance exists, and that all this may manifest in AGI take-over within our lifetime. Even the contrarians who advocate a Dune-inspired “Butlerian jihad” against AI accept these basic claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think of AI, you likely don’t mean facial recognition programs or traffic monitoring software, even though these descend from recent concepts of AI. Self-driving cars and LLMs are probably closer to the mark, at least for now, because they seem to operate with more autonomy and self-direction than we are used to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the acid test for “real” AI is independence from humans, up to the point of replacing them. Those creating deep learning tools are under pressure to show that their creations reach that standard. What happens in practice, though, is that companies simply hide the presence of human work and correction beneath the guise of a seamless experience. The human labor needed for everything from labeling data to editing AI outputs is massive and growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company Scale AI made its name, its $7.3 billion market cap, and its client list ranging from OpenAI to the U.S. military based on providing precisely that human support. While the company’s branding is that of a tech company, it founded an in-house agency called Remotasks to manage its core operations, the nature of which is something more like “outsourcing services.” Via Remotasks, Scale AI hires about 240,000 workers for data labeling services, many of them in regions like Africa and Asia. The company </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/04/11/how-alexandr-wang-turned-an-army-of-clickworkers-into-a-73-billion-ai-unicorn/?sh=12a6cd377326"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a strict brand separation between the two. While the company’s position is that this is for client privacy, it’s hard to ignore the reality that “outsourcing services” is a far less sexy investor hook than AI and is far easier for competitors—of which Scale AI has many—to disrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the scale of global investment, as well as firms thinking in terms of massive economic transitions, the disparity between the ideology and the tool fuels the hype cycle. Employers think the tools are more advanced than they are, employees think their jobs are more at risk than they are, and investors think their gains are just around the corner. People ask which jobs they can eliminate, but not which ones they have to create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one recent case, scriptwriters have been </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hollywood-screenwriters-artificial-intelligence-guardrails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about producers tricking them into editing scripts produced by ChatGPT instead of hiring them to write originals. However, conflicts over automation are not new in the film industry. The reality is that the elimination and merger of film jobs due to technology were occurring long before AI came on the scene. I asked a couple of friends who worked in Montreal’s huge film and music scenes what people were expecting. Their responses were surprisingly unfazed. “Honestly, the middle has already emptied out,” said Sarah, who does post-production work on feature films and series content. “The storyboard timelines that were 3-6 months are now a month or less, and so much has been combined that the same person might even be directing work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about the artist worries about images and music just becoming repurposed as training data for their own replacements? “Repurposing content is so normal already and not all of it is legal Getty Images-type stuff,” said my other friend, a music producer. “The internet already gave people the ability to trade and share materials easily. AI isn&#8217;t fundamentally changing that, but it does change the compression effect. If you&#8217;re using prompts on a generative AI tool like Midjourney to create art, you often lose some control over the final product, at least right now.” Were they worried about tools getting good enough to actually outperform them? “I mean, what are they getting trained on?” he answered. “The mass production might be a problem in the end. It&#8217;s good to democratize a creative tool, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the high-quality output will increase. What happens when half of images online are AI-produced and that’s what Midjourney is learning from? It&#8217;s probably not as divergent as the purely human work it&#8217;s learning on now. I don’t think it’s going to make for better art.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both reported that despite the growing use of AI tools, many of their colleagues didn’t have a strong understanding of the underlying technical basics of generative AI. Absent this, people are left to operate on the assumptions of ideological hype. The problem is that this hype has already been propagated across industries and mass culture, while the work of figuring out how best to use the tools is usually slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not unique to AI; industries tend to move in lockstep. Trends, best practices, and “industry standards” tend to dominate both new and established sectors and both large and small firms. Think of how every company you use started deciding that they needed an app; that happened despite the average user of the average app </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23743915/iphone-android-apps-airline-dentist-pandemic-data-privacy-restaurant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abandoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it after a couple of uses. CEOs are as prey to the hype as anyone. A large organization that actually bucks the ideological alignments represented by “industry standards” is rare, and will usually come under immense pressure to conform.</span></p>
<h3><b>You Can’t Trust the Signals</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, the economist Friederich Hayek described markets as operating on price signals that reflected the actions people took on the basis of their private knowledge and beliefs. Hype changes the nature of these signals. Like in a standard Hayekian market, people in AI or broader tech markets are looking at price signals and the behavior of market participants as sources of information. But when a sufficiently large proportion of investors are operating on ideological tropes, those signals reflect collective hype instead an aggregation of private bets based on diverse approximations of reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is everyone necessarily fooled by the hype; for savvy investors, the bubble itself is the opportunity. George Soros once </span><a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/why-would-a-billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-rush-to-buy-a-bubble--15351476"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “When I see a bubble forming, I rush to buy, adding fuel to the fire.” The results are clear: just this year, Nvidia—whose chips are fundamental to the current wave of AI projects—added $700 billion in market capitalization in 2023, traded at almost </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/779f8bdd-5e21-4486-9a82-9b21c34a1b60"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its expected revenues, and rocketed to the top of JP Morgan’s Hedge Fund VIP Basket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is far from the only tech market operating on ideological hype. Cryptocurrency and vanity projects like the metaverse relied on the same pattern. Now that rising interest rates have stemmed the flow of easy money, the price of ideological misjudgment is increasing. Tech was disproportionately reliant on the low-interest-rate economy. The downturn hit tech fast but took several months to start impacting the rest of the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real story here is that these downturns didn’t affect much real value at all, either beyond the tech world or even within it. If Twitter is a good heuristic for just how much capital the systematic overvaluation of tech has soaked up, the misallocation constitutes a systematic disorder in the global economy. These are not market signals that can be trusted.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The reach of this hype is not equally distributed. The intensity gets higher as one gets closer to the epistemic cartel of the tech industry proper. In contrast, legacy sectors that run on personal relationships—like finance or law—value their core employees and this affects how they use the technologies involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investment manager I spoke to told me that experimentation with products like ChatGPT is still largely left to “vanguardists” like himself in his area of finance. In the broader finance industry, IBM estimates AI tool adoption at about </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/GVAGA3JP"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of professionals. His main concern was freeing up time for the tasks that actually mattered. “I use ChatGPT if I’m transcribing conversations, pulling out insights from a paper, stuff like that. For drudgery. It’s like having a personal assistant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did he sense fear about job losses? “At the middle and senior level, finance runs on weak relationships. You know lots of people somewhat well, and more importantly, you can figure out the unique deals that no one else sees,” he explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the lower rungs, it’s different. But there’s been gradual upskilling already for the last hundred years. It used to be that someone paid a secretary to handle their busy work, but now an assistant will handle multiple executives using Teams, Outlook, and other apps. I’d expect the same with lower-level analysts: maybe it’s a quarter of the number of people hired, employees make $120,000 instead of $60,000, and their job has become using machine learning to assist mid-to-senior level people.” The real opportunity, he thought, might be using AI as an excuse to remove low performers. “Large firms are full of dead wood. Machine learning might be the ideal rationale to do reductions without blaming any one person. Hey, it&#8217;s just ‘technological changes!’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal field yielded similar results. I spoke with two lawyers, Zach and Shannon, both of whom work at mid-size offices. The AI tools they used were targeted at lawyers and mainly for editing documents and sorting specialized contracts that need public disclosure. “The real work for lawyers isn’t in sitting and drafting anyways,” Zach told me. “It’s in quarterbacking deals and doing syndication on the fly. Diligence work is basically a way to pay your dues, but no one really wants to do entry-level work like that.” While Zach thought that support staff might get slimmed down, Shannon hadn’t even seen that yet: “The research tasks are changing, but it’s not at the point yet where you can do it without an actual person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insularity of law and finance probably made them overlook the potential of AI technologies in some ways. Deep learning tools might cause certain kinds of job loss, but these companies tended to evaluate them by how they increased the value of their best-performing people, whose real contributions were often their personal judgment and ability to cultivate relationships with clients and stakeholders. Distance from the social influence of the tech industry also gave them resistance to tech-centric ideologies about the nature of AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing independent assumptions and models about AI is a tall order, especially for a company justifying its decisions to boards and shareholders operating on the same hype as everyone else. Rival ecosystems to Silicon Valley, like Wall Street or Washington D.C., have their own operating ideologies through which they interpret the world in ways that serve that particular industry. The task at hand for those trying to think about the most important problems in society—and the real potential or implications of deep learning—is to create an independent epistemic environment with both correct information and sane models of the world. This can’t be done in isolation, but it doesn’t take too many people either, at least at the start. The fundamentals of good analysis are good first principles and rigorous empirical assessment, and these usually require collaboration in small groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting AI technologies as a dynamic of deep learning tools replacing humans violates both these fundamentals. Seeing it as a reorganization of certain kinds of labor and production, where human capital is reallocated to more useful roles, is more faithful to them. Nothing deep learning has yielded has even a theoretical pathway to altering the most fundamental operating norms of society or of institutions. Basic patterns like the growth and decay of institutions, principal-agent conflicts, or the tendency for bureaucracies to prioritize their own expansion, will all continue. However significant the changes that AI tools do make possible, they will operate downstream of these more fundamental patterns in society. Good models of AI technologies, or any other category of technology, are therefore downstream of good models of society overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no immediate rival to the tech ideology&#8217;s dominant narrative around AI, we will likely see AI-branded technologies go through more than one bubble in the years to come. Their bursts will probably not undermine the propagation of the underlying technologies over the long run. But the real value of these technologies for material or social development is, on net, far lower than the hype suggests. In all likelihood, we will stop thinking of many deep learning tools through the lens of AI as their real functional niches become established and unremarkable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until the AI ideology faces displacement by something closer to reality, the systematic overvaluation of the tech industry as the vanguard of material progress is set to continue.</span></p>

</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/">Palladium</a>.
			[content:encoded] <p>If America is a story, then who better to diagnose its ills and prescribe a treatment than a novelist? Walter Kirn was born in 1962 in Ohio and grew up in Minnesota. After Princeton and Oxford he embarked on a literary career in New York media, reviewing books and writing for <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, <em>Time</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, and <em>Harper’s</em>.</p>
<p>Kirn’s 2001 novel <em>Up in the Air</em> was made into the critically-acclaimed 2009 film starring George Clooney. His memoir <em>Lost in the Meritocracy: The Undereducation of an Overachiever</em> chronicles his own adventure going from rural Minnesota to the Ivy League. Lately, he co-hosts the podcast <a href="https://www.racket.news/s/america-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America This Week</a> and is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.countyhighway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>County Highway</em></a>, a new print magazine about America in the form of a nineteenth-century newspaper.</p>
<p>In late June, I flew to Montana and drove out to meet Kirn at his home in Livingston, on the Yellowstone River, where he’s lived for 33 years. Livingston’s last industry, a local sawmill, fully shuttered a few years ago, and the town now sustains itself on summer tourists to Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>Downtown Livingston could be confused for a Hollywood backdrop, which suits its resident part-time Writers Guild of America screenwriter. He tells me he’s on strike for “the duration” and can’t talk to the producer of the new film he’s writing. He’s also working on a new book that’s a travelog of his road trip across the Mountain West during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Between meals in Livingston’s hipper cafes and a long drive out into the mountains in his pickup truck, I ask Kirn how it was that the big American story got so far off script.</p>
<p><strong>There seems to be a growing chasm between the real-life experiences that people have and the grand narratives about our common story—about what we suppose is normal. How did we get here?  </strong></p>
<p>I’m 60 years old. I went to grade school in Minnesota, in very small rural public schools. I was aware from maybe the fourth or fifth grade, through film strips and prepared lesson plans from textbook companies, that we lived in an endangered world. Outside of basic teaching, we were given the overriding message that we should be optimistic about things like computers and space, but there was a louder drumbeat about pollution, racial division, and the Cold War.</p>
<p>Because I was an ambitious kid who wanted to succeed in school, I was always attempting to discern the lesson behind the lesson. What I saw was that I was being asked to be very concerned and anxious about mankind’s stupidity and selfishness. That seemed to be the lesson underlying the pollution lectures—that people in their cars and their desire to have too many things were dirtying up the world.</p>
<p>The Cold War lesson was more sophisticated and went on even longer into junior high and high school. It centered on books like <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em>, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, and other depictions of the dangers of a totalitarian world. We were asked to congratulate ourselves as young Americans on our freedom and clarity and basic goodness compared to this lurking threat from the Soviet Union, in which the citizens were all forced to think alike, act alike, and be alike.</p>
<p>Over the years, it has caused me great consternation that the heavy aversion to totalitarian, dictatorial, and top-down systems that was implanted in me is now kind of useless—and even dangerous. As I discern trends in our society that seem to resemble those I was warned against and raise my hand to say that I don’t like this, I’m told that, somehow, I’m out of step, I’m overly alarmed, and I’m maybe even on the wrong side.</p>
<p>But, I want to reply, this is only what a seventh-grade Minnesota public school student was taught to fear, taught to be on the lookout for, and now you’re telling me it constitutes some kind of dissident position to be afraid of these things?</p>
<p>The final lesson wasn’t that any of this was inevitable, but that by growing up and being good citizens and standing with the right kind of people, it could all be averted. It was portrayed as navigable. It wasn’t portrayed as catastrophic but merely as a set of challenges that we would no doubt overcome. Even the Soviet Union and the threat of the atomic bomb were construed as something that would probably not occur because we were so strong, so influential, so virtuous.</p>
<p>As I grew up and went to college in the early 80s, the sense of these dangers seemed to dissipate somewhat. I knew that on the religious right, among the born-again evangelicals, there was a continuing fear of some kind of theological apocalypse. Because my family had converted to Mormonism when I was twelve, and because I was a listener to late-night talk radio, out in the country—which was dominated by current event shows done by apocalyptic religious types—I was very aware of this possibility. But it did not feel like something that was bearing down on us in the real world—perhaps in some spiritual realm, that I, for one, didn’t buy.</p>
<p>Religious apocalypticism I found somewhat entertaining. Environmental apocalypticism seemed to be weakening as I grew up because the air and water got cleaner and everyone who had a soul seemed to be on the side of conservation, environmental protection, and so on. Then came the fall of the Soviet Union, and by that point I was intellectually mature—out of college at Princeton and Oxford, writing and editing in New York glossy media—and everything seemed like a kind of carnival. You’re living in a prosperous country whose chief enemy has just disintegrated.</p>
<p><strong>The end of history. </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I’m capable of reading Fukuyama at that point and seeing that democracy has triumphed and we’re in our final stage, after which everything is going to be a steady state of liberal democratic paradise. Or if not paradise, then at least some kind of predictable and peaceful world. It was only toward the end of the 90s with the rise of global warming that I felt like this was <em>déjà vu</em>—returning to something like the tone I remembered as a school child. Then came 9/11, the War on Terror, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Still, though, there was not a sense that these were insuperable challenges. Global warming was something that, through some adjustment of our carbon output, we could deal with. The War on Terror, though frightening, consisted of outlier groups that we now had the laws and the military capabilities to counter. It was only around the mid-2010s, with the election of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, that I felt the clouds really begin to gather again.</p>
<p>When I went to cover the Republican Convention in Cleveland for <em>Harper’s </em>in 2016—this is not remembered very clearly now—we had the Ferguson riots, and we had a few really astonishing outbreaks of what seemed like racial violence. A bunch of Dallas police officers were shot not long before the convention. Reporters were actually warned, in a way that made the news, that they might want to wear bulletproof vests in Cleveland; it was imagined that it might very well turn into Chicago in 1968.</p>
<p>My earliest memories as a child were of the Vietnam War on TV and the student protests. Bridges in Minneapolis were blocked by protesters, bonfires were lit, and there were bombings all the time. If you turned on the TV until about 1976, you were getting a constant down-beat feed of internal dissent—and, of course, assassinations. I was old enough to be conscious by the time Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy were shot.</p>
<p>Right around the time I went to Cleveland, I saw that my wife was concerned for my well-being and that there was reason for her concern in the rhetoric that was breaking out on the news. But when I got to Cleveland, nothing much happened. Alex Jones was driving around with a bullhorn and there was a lot of noise and circus-like convention rhetoric, but nothing bad happened. I thought, wow, this is all overblown.</p>
<p>At the convention, I felt that I was at the tip of a narrative that had caused me to expect something to happen that did not occur. I started to be skeptical about that new apocalyptic strain. I thought, why do they keep on this in the absence of actual events? At the time, I was writing a <a href="https://harpers.org/author/walterkirn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural column</a> for <em>Harper’s</em>. My filter for the world is literary and dramatic, not political, chiefly. I see things in terms of stories, plays, dramas, characters, symbols, themes, and motifs.</p>
<p>As the Trump presidency started, almost instantly—even back at the convention—the notion was that he was a kind of instrument of dictatorial Russia. I was thinking, are they going to keep this up into his presidency? I can see why, in the heat of a campaign, you might throw all kinds of overheated accusations at somebody.</p>
<p>I had expected Trump to win, especially after the convention. I was astonished by the novelty of his performance. He came on the stage like a casino pit boss, shooting his cuffs, rearing up as tall as he could be, coming out from a curtain that first showed his silhouette to all this spectacular music. Four years earlier, in 2012, I had written a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/106465/opposite-nature-romney-obama-campaigns-more-interesting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover story</a> for <em>The New Republic </em>contrasting Obama and Romney—two very polished and establishment figures between whom it’s now, in retrospect, hard even to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Trump ran through the American predicament in very dark terms, as if he was our last defense against some vaguely described cultural and economic enemy that was undermining the normal progress of the country. It reminded me of when punk rock came to the Midwest. This was a new sound—good, bad, or whatever. It breaks through the encrusted coating on the brain and makes more neurons fire than usual. If nothing else is clear about America, it’s that our society is addicted to novelty and Trump was something completely new. The archetype of the salesman had not had much play in our politics in a very long time.</p>
<p>When Trump won, I saw that rather than come together, as had been the norm after previous presidential elections, the suspicion of this figure ramped up. There were lists in the mainstream press of publications that were suspected to be Russian fronts; they included all sorts of outlets I happened to read, from <em>CounterPunch</em> on the left to the <em>Drudge Report </em>on the right. I thought, are we really going to push the narrative that the president is a Russian agent and a huge part of our media has been infiltrated and subverted by enemy agents? That America is headed for some terrible reckoning over race, international alliances, and so on?</p>
<p>Since the fall of 2016, it has gotten worse and worse. More American institutions have been cast as dubious, unpatriotic, and perhaps manipulated from abroad. More American attitudes, whether they be religious, cultural, or even intellectual, have been redlined as dangerous. More individuals from citizens to media figures to authors and artists have been cast in the role of dangerous dissenters.</p>
<p>The sum total, to bring it right up to the present, is that we now live in an age of profound anxiety. The political emergency, the environmental threat, and later COVID, were all globbed together as one giant example of our need for vast controlling authority that would keep us from dying. No longer could the citizens be trusted to make their own decisions, associate freely, speak openly, and spontaneously carry out their lives. All the risks had risen to the ultimate level, DEFCON 1. Our communications had to be monitored—and even manicured. Politics was too dangerous to be left in the hands of the population. Very suddenly, on every front, there seemed to be a rationale for total control and also a scenario in which, should we fail to yield to that control, doom was certain.</p>
<p>This is not to speak to the truth or accuracy or validity of these warnings, but merely to the social and emotional cost of them. We talk a lot about environmental sustainability but I am also concerned with emotional and social sustainability. I see no way that we can sustain this level of panic, fear, mutual suspicion, and anger. Unlike a lot of my colleagues, other writers and journalists, I don’t blame it on Donald Trump. I see him as a player in a drama that involves many characters, but whose basic storyline was set before he even came along, and which is now grabbing a whole new set of characters like Elon Musk and other supposed villains.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Montana for thirty-three years. Montana is often portrayed in the national press, even recently in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, as some hotbed of reactionary and ultraconservative rebellion. Every few years, Montana is brought out on the stage and painted as a haven for antisocial rebels. Because I live here and know that’s not true, I have a hard time with the new schema around white supremacy and so on. If the place is so damn full of white supremacists then how come I haven’t met them? I drive everywhere, I talk to everyone. I consider everyone to be a source for my journalism, from the guy at the hardware store to a farmer whose truck is broken down by the road. I gather stories from all of them, and it’s just not true that there is some nascent revolution about to break out here.</p>
<p>But the fact that it is imputed so often has started to scare me. Because those who want conflict and those who profit from it are creating boogeymen all over the place. That causes me to think there is, not a plan, but rather an expectation that events will occur in which this thematic structure can be brought out for political gain. I await that moment with trepidation.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the social and emotional state of affairs, in which people treat each other with suspicion. That has not been the normal condition in American society, has it? </strong></p>
<p>It’s absolutely the opposite of the normal condition!</p>
<p><strong>This fact seems so basic and so true and yet so ignored and unremarked upon in favor of these other narrative explanations—like this idea that you should be very afraid of the other half of the country.</strong></p>
<p>COVID was a nonstop opportunity for narratives about how one part of America does not care if the other part of America lives or dies. States that were relatively laissez-faire about their COVID rules were depicted as wanting some kind of death cult vengeance on more progressive states. It was as though everyone was carrying this grenade called “COVID” and the good people were making sure that the pin was in place while the bad people wanted to throw it at the others.</p>
<p>The notion that people without symptoms of a terrible disease were the most likely to spread it allowed for an <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> science fiction terror of other people to which I had seen no equivalent in my whole life. I’m now supposed to fear other people as such? Their decision to walk too close to me or to travel is in itself an aggressive act? Not locking yourself down, covering your face, and withdrawing from society was <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a murderous heart. That was nuts!</p>
<p>It’s hard to be optimistic about a society that would frighten and harm itself at these levels with such obvious economic consequences, especially for people at the bottom and especially for the young. During COVID there were kids in this town who were harming themselves. They had lost their social lives at school—maybe they weren’t getting regular meals. They were unmoored from their social lives and their emotional bonds. That was a real disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the big stories to shed light on these disasters? Everyone I know has some experience of deep distress themselves or within one degree of separation, but these are interpreted as personal crises that people are expected to bear on an individual basis. They are divorced from any big narratives, which focus on these supposed massive emergencies, the mutual suspicion, and why you should be deathly afraid, and so on. The big narratives don’t reflect these personal traumas.</strong></p>
<p>In America today, if you are having experiences going about your day that run counter to the mega-narratives on the news and social media, you have a choice. Do you compare notes with other people? If you do, you have an instinctive sense that somehow you are endangering yourself. Because you’ve seen other people be mocked for it and examples made of famous figures who have stepped out of line.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this the very essence of social sense-making and reality—to be able to talk to your family and friends and not to have your every experience intermediated or interpreted narratively for you in advance by your iPhone or some kind of institutional apparatus?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a Solzhenitsyn quote that at some point we wondered if we were allowed to talk about the experiences of our own lives, and I think America is at that point. I live in a kind of throwback America. I live in a town of 8,000 in Montana. Because it’s a tourist town, and because it’s become a sort of shelter-from-the-storm city since COVID, it has people moving in from all over. Even the newcomers kind of conform to the preexisting culture, which is to meet at the post office, talk, stand on the corner, share the news, and understand life through gossip, storytelling, and anecdote. That’s still a legitimate way to understand life here. It was sorely tested during the pandemic in particular, when people were afraid to talk.</p>
<p>The main news source in this town is the steps of the downtown post office, but people hurried up and down with eyes averted and masks over their faces. That media source was blotted out. People started to understand things going on here through social media and even national outlets rather than by talking to someone who had just been there. The crushing of the anecdotal, the personal experience, as a valid form of cognition was amazing to watch. And it wasn’t completely successful here, but I imagine in other places that don’t have as deep a tradition of street corner news, it was much worse.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, this process was almost total in San Francisco or in Boston, where I’m from and lived for part of the pandemic. These are places where people were already more atomized, not only in the sense that they may not have known their neighbors to begin with but also in a lot of their social life. Even with local friends, life occurs by text message or on social media.</strong></p>
<p>Growing up, I thought that if a town had a Dairy Queen, it was a city, and I looked out toward the Oz-like horizons where stores were open late and pizza was available. In the American West in general, especially in the small-town Mountain West and the Midwest, there is a high tolerance for crankiness and outsider opinion. Partly, this is due to the person-to-person game-of-telephone distortions that come with gossip and oral sharing of information.</p>
<p>If you grow up in farm country, you grow up in a place where everyone has an opinion but the weather has the final say. It’s a place where all sorts of forces exist, which outsiders don’t understand at all, that govern your daily life. If you grow up in rural America, you can’t afford to hate your neighbor or withdraw into tribal groups because your car might break down and someone from one of those groups might be your only hope of getting a ride to the tire store or the gas station.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a dependency on other people in that context. One of the things you get with the rise of digital technology is less material reliance on other people. Once you don’t have to rely on other people, you can let go of the emotional and psychological dependence too.</strong></p>
<p>You can edit people out of your life. You can block them. Here, I can’t edit my neighbors out of my life. If I decide to have a feud with someone, I better be pretty stoic, because I’m guaranteed to see them the next day at the grocery store or need them when I pull into the mechanic with a busted fan belt. So tribal and factional withdrawal is not an option in any practical way—unless you don’t need to go to the store, or the post office, or leave your house at all since you have a one-way Amazon channel through which to get all your goods.</p>
<p><strong>But isn’t that the tendency of the way things are going even in a place like Livingston, Montana?</strong></p>
<p>It certainly is. There’s a tendency toward the curation of your social life at a granular level. It starts on social media but it creeps out into the street. Although I would give Montana a solid B+ in its ability to retain civility and humanity in the face of these constant gales of apocalyptic catastrophizing media, there has been a degradation even here. It’s because you can make virtual friends to replace the real friends you’ve lost on the street. You can get people to agree with you in ways that you probably couldn’t if you went down to the bar. You can obviously create a synthetic social life that is almost, in some ways, as gratifying as the one you used to have—surely, it’s less risky in some essential facets.</p>
<p><strong>It’s easier on your ego probably. </strong></p>
<p>And you don’t risk a fistfight!</p>
<p><strong>In the metropoles where people are so atomized, and supposedly every need can be met by Uber or Amazon or Twitter, the default preference is clearly never to escape one’s own little bubble. Why would you risk it? Someone could invalidate the story you are telling yourself about who you are, what is true, and who the heroes and villains are in your own psychodrama. </strong></p>
<p>I like to imagine the world from the vantage point of an alien or someone who doesn’t speak the language and see what’s going on in structural terms. I think you hit on it. Instead of this lateral relationship with our community and our neighbors and our family, what’s being proposed is that everyone triangulate their relationships through an authority center. Whether the method of that triangulation involves having <a href="https://compactmag.com/article/battleground-thanksgiving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking points</a> for Thanksgiving dinner or just going on social media to find out what good people think and then repeating it, the trend seems to be toward the outsourcing of all responses, thoughts, and reactions.</p>
<p>Why do I hate that so much? Maybe that’s the solution to our ignorant and fallen status in society. Let’s take the devil’s advocate there. Over the last few years, we’ve been told that there are certain infallible organs of truth: the intelligence community, Science with a capital S, mainstream media, etc.</p>
<p>It was my privilege to meet a physicist named Murray Gell-Mann who discovered the subatomic particle known as the quark. But he also is the namesake for a principle of skeptical inquiry called the Gell-Mann Effect. When you read one article or piece in a newspaper on a subject you happen to know something about and you find it to be misinformed, wrong, or even deceptive, why do you then assume that the same paper is accurate about subjects that you don’t know about? Why would you extend credence to that source on other topics when you’ve caught it lying or being wrong about one you do know about?</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an answer to that? </strong></p>
<p>Logically, of course not. My dad was a lawyer. I see a lot in terms of the law. If a witness is caught lying early in their testimony and can be shown to be lying, or just nutty or incompetent, it colors everything they say afterward; they are discredited, and sometimes that’s the end of their usefulness in that trial. But this doesn’t extend to journalism. A certain amount of wrongness can be put down to just error and mistaken-though-well-intentioned failure. But after a while, that no longer explains it and you start to see almost systematic wrongness on certain topics particularly. So why do we keep going back to the well for poisoned water?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, this is what I want to know.</strong></p>
<p>It’s very interesting. I have several guesses. I was a Mormon in my teen years. Young adolescents are the most skeptical beings. They are starting to catch adults in inconsistencies and acts of hypocrisy, so they are really heat-seeking missiles for error and contradiction and lies. So you’re in the Mormon church, and it’s all your friends and your parents&#8217; friends. And someone with status in the church, maybe an elder, says something. Maybe it’s about doctrine or the news, and it’s just a whopper. You know it’s untrue or absurd. You are then faced with a problem. Do you leave the church? Do you stop going? Do you lose your social circle? Do you flush down the toilet all the stuff that you bought into? Do you retcon it all as junk and then go off on your own? What is there to go off into? Isolation? Loneliness? You know that you’ll be mocked once you disappear. They’ll be talking behind your back.</p>
<p>Not that the newspapers will talk about you behind your back if you stop reading them. But if you’re a journalist, and you stop writing for them, they will. I have seen endless examples over the past few years of journalists who left the consensus on some particular issue and then woke up one day to find themselves the subject of a “What Happened To X” article.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persona non grata.</em></strong></p>
<p>So one of the reasons you don’t leave if you’re a journalist is you will be disciplined, mocked, and cast out. If you’re just a consumer of news, you think, but where else do I go?</p>
<p><strong>But surely there are truer big-picture stories we in journalism could tell about what is going on? That’s what I’m asking.</strong></p>
<p>There are. But you see, I’ve lived through an economic change of fortune for the press in my lifetime since I’ve been writing for it. It’s an expensive proposition to send people out, to have people in the field, to interview a lot of sources, to get on planes, and to maintain stringers like <em>Time Magazine</em> did in every major community in the country. Why do that when you can supposedly find out about anything virtually?</p>
<p><strong>You can just report the Twitter feed.</strong></p>
<p>Most reporting now is some kind of Escher-like circle that turns in on itself. Almost all stories now are media stories. Hard news stories are now media stories in which the most salient element is how something will play and whether it will serve the interest of the good people or the bad people. The underlying actuality is secondary. It’s as though reality only exists to provide fodder for media now.</p>
<p><strong>A total simulacra in which the referent to the real only exists for the symbol, not the other way around.</strong></p>
<p>In that, it’s all literary criticism. If you want to find out who actually believes what, you have a very hard time. But if you want to find out which imagery supports what narrative, they can tell you all day long. And as an actual literary critic who has made money for decades reviewing books and weighing in on art and so on, to see that domain take over the news is utterly amazing and disheartening for me.</p>
<p>All events are to be judged according to optics. I remember when that kind of language—that sort of second-order critical language—entered the conversation on the news. A few years back they started using the term “the narrative” and a few years before that they would talk about “optics.” But now it’s just full-blown. There’s almost no other topic.</p>
<p><strong>It’s just the appearance, the perception. </strong></p>
<p>Everything is a kind of dream. And it’s another way in which primary reality is being lost. In fact, to even use the phrase “primary reality” as I sit here causes me to recoil slightly because I know it marks me as some kind of nineteenth-century character or Enlightenment throwback. What am I, John Locke, sitting here talking about natural law? I don’t want to be trapped in this critique, but I can’t help but make it.</p>
<p><strong>So how do we wake up from the dream? </strong></p>
<p>Well, that’s the real question. I’m going to stipulate—no one has to agree with me on this, but I have tried the case and come to this conclusion for myself—that between the deceptiveness, the agenda-driven nature, and the social-media-oriented vapidity of the press, it is no longer a reliable source of information about the world. It’s a very good source of information about itself. If you wish to know who’s up and who’s down, who’s in and who’s out, who scored points and lost points, it’s a great scorecard. But if you’re looking to find out what’s going on, it’s a terrible one. In fact, it will actually conceal what’s going on in almost every respect. So I’ve given up on it.</p>
<p>The press is a document, it’s a stage play, it’s an artifact, and insofar as I want to use its own methods and study it as such, it’s kind of fascinating. But as a guide to what’s happening? It’s worse than useless. It’s beyond propaganda. Propaganda was a kind of simple word that described boosting a point of view in a pretty obvious way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Propaganda fide</em></strong><strong>. The propagation of the faith. </strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Destroy the Hun! Look at the Kaiser with his bloodthirsty fangs! Here’s a real American with muscles holding a bayonet! Propaganda usually could be seen as such, and you almost liked it for that reason. It was morale-boosting. It made you hate the enemy and love your side. It simplified issues and you kind of knew it was propaganda. You let it work on you the same way you let a salesman work on you because you want to be sold. It gets you aroused for the fight and it reminds you of the basic values involved.</p>
<p>So propaganda is almost a simple and innocent version of behavioral pressure. This is something else. This is a world-concealing layer of diversionary and illogical and internally inconsistent noise, under which the world exists somewhere.</p>
<p>We’re like passengers in a plane who know we’re flying over Kansas but can only see a cloud layer. And drawn on the cloud layer are simple pictures of Kansas. Do we want to see underneath it or will we be content with this cartoon that’s drawn on the cloud? I can’t be content with the cartoon—not as a human being, not as a journalist, and certainly not as a novelist.</p>
<p>There is no excuse as a novelist for not knowing how people are actually living and behaving and thinking. You can maybe write a satire of people who are misled and who are acting robotically according to engineered inputs, but you have to know it’s satire. You can’t write sincerely about that as though that is reality; you must see below it. Your job is to see below it.</p>
<p>How do you deal with it? I’ve grown increasingly radical in my beliefs about this. At first, I thought you interrogated and inspected it and looked for patterns. You almost reverse-engineered it. You looked at the news layer knowing it was false but also that it was false in certain ways that showed certain trends. You could detect what’s being hidden and what’s being pushed, in the way that the CIA used to analyze pictures of party congresses at the Kremlin to see who was sitting where and who wasn’t in the picture at all. The idea was that I could decode reality by deconstructing this information layer that’s being spread out before me. But I no longer think this is fruitful.</p>
<p><strong>You hear people say that they consume “both sides” of the news—because they watch both FOX and MSNBC, or read both </strong><strong><em>The</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>New York Times </em></strong><strong>and the </strong><strong><em>Wall Street Journal—</em></strong><strong>and imagine that they are well-informed.</strong></p>
<p>Garbage in, garbage out. This idea is that you can somehow split the difference between various sides. But anyone who is at all a systematic thinker realizes the sides were conceived in opposition to each other. So if the first one was wrong, the second one is just the opposite of it, but it’s as wrong in the opposite way. And maybe a third one came along that was some kind of combination of the two, but it was just the combination of two things that were wrong. And now I’m going to put them together, divide by three, and come up with the real answer?</p>
<p>You don’t get any closer to the truth by performing that operation. All that operation reveals is who the powers that be are, what they think is going to work, and what’s succeeding now in terms of getting attention versus what was succeeding yesterday. You are fooling yourself if you think you can decrypt this misinformation layer—whatever you might call it—and get to reality. This game of running a counterintelligence operation on our information streams appeals to the ego, and to our sense of intrigue and our own skill, but there’s no reason to believe it gets us any closer to the truth and it may indeed take us further away. On issue after issue, we seem to be involved in prefabricated dialectics, oppositions, and architectures. Maybe the issue <em>du jour</em> isn’t even an issue at all.</p>
<p><strong>That’s my big question here. If we were the aliens, like you mentioned, or if we’re looking back as historians a hundred years from now, are we going to care about any of these narratives? </strong></p>
<p>Dude, I already can’t remember the significance of things that I was urged were of apocalyptic import a few years ago. Will we remember them? No—because structurally the assault is on memory itself in issue after issue. A memory is a drag on action. It causes you to raise your hand and go, wait a second.</p>
<p>Let’s take the problem of where COVID came from. The very latest, as we speak now in June of 2023, is that COVID leaked from a lab in China. It’s pretty strongly suggested that it came from a lab in China that was doing terrible research and that the virus itself is some kind of engineered entity. Go back three months. This was still being debated, and people who were fundamentalists on the lab leak were, still three months ago, certainly six months ago, thought to be somehow unkosher, perhaps xenophobic, and maybe Trump-adjacent radicals. But if we go all the way back to the beginnings of COVID, it was almost the first common-sense assumption. Each slice of this narrative is only credible if you forget the one before. Wait a second, I’m being told that the much-vaunted American intelligence community has now “officially determined” the same thing that got me kicked off of social media eight months ago for agreeing with?</p>
<p>It’s so weird for me because I was raised on all of these fables like <em>The</em> <em>Emperor’s New Clothes</em> and the one about the good old boy who put his finger in the dyke. What was more valorized in my youth than anything else was being the lonely person who, like in the Norman Rockwell painting, stands up at the town meeting, raises his hand, and says, “I won’t stand for this,” or, “over my dead body.” Now that person is subject to an FBI investigation because they did it at a school board meeting. And I, for noting this cultural change, am some kind of dissident, when all I’m doing is remembering what I was taught?</p>
<p><strong>Entire generations were taught the same lessons. Are most people just remarkably flexible? Did they not learn the moral of the story in the first place? Did they forget it when it was no longer convenient or enforced in the same way? </strong></p>
<p>Kids who are in their early twenties now, who I speak to because I have family members that age, will often tell me that they feel very old. You’re 23 and you feel old? “Yeah, because I remember what it was like not to have an iPhone.” Or, “I grew up watching <em>Hannah Montana </em>and a few basic shows on TV rather than TikTok.” What used to be called generational change now takes place culturally like every two and a half years. I’m meeting 20-year-olds who already feel ancient compared to 14-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>I feel like I’m from the nineteenth century, and I’m 27.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And so where is memory going? Is it that people are forgetting these particular cultural lessons I cited about standing out, being skeptical, speaking up when you see a wrong, and going against the crowd? Every damn movie I saw as a kid was about not succumbing to peer pressure. The entire anti-drug propaganda effort of my youth was about being the kid who sat back while everybody else got drunk and high. They trained me in that and now I’m expected to forget it?</p>
<p>But once you start preaching the virtues of forgetting, everything gets forgotten. The reason people want to forget is that they don’t want to be slowed down. Everything that you remember is in a sense stuck to a world that has now been superseded. Forget the particular moral lessons. To remember at all is to be inefficient in your encounter with the present.</p>
<p>One of my formative intellectual influences is a guy who some consider a crackpot, a psychologist named Julian Jaynes who taught at Princeton while I was there. He was an outlier in the academic community and he published one book called <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em>.</p>
<p>His thesis was that before about 3,000 years ago, consciousness was an entirely different thing. People didn’t “think” consciously, they experienced life as getting commands from a seemingly outside god-like agency. Instead of the modern form of consciousness, “I think I should go to the store,” causing me to get up and go to the store, ancient people heard a command: “Go to the store.” And it was often in the voice of an ancestor, a leader, or a god. Jaynes claimed the primordial form of consciousness was a lot like what we now call schizophrenia; it was hearing voices, hearing commands, and acting immediately on them: “Go out and start planting!” I think we may be returning to that state, where consciousness is no longer an interior process, one that we carry around with us, one that is locked in the suitcase of the mind.</p>
<p>If you want to throw off the ballast of the past in order to be more responsive to the present, there’s a logical next step which is to be no longer loyal to the present—to exist in a constant state of anticipation—such that one does not even form memories to get attached to! You don’t bond with the present because you’ve learned that it’s about to become the past, and the past is a bad thing, and memories only hold you back, so why even form them? Why even have experiences? Because if I have an experience that lodges deeply enough in me, it will turn into a memory and it will hold me back.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to sail in front of the wind! I need to get on the front of the wave. Not only do you not want to have memory, you don’t even want to have profound experiences! Where are you then? You might think that you’re on a great individualist adventure ahead of everything else. But what you really are is a total pawn of someone else’s power. You are a perfect victim. You are owned. Not only are you not attached to the past, but you don’t even fall in love with the present. You can’t even counter their story with your own. You don’t have a story at all.</p>
<p>As a dramatist, I can tell you that without memory, you don’t even have a story. Unless Othello remembers what it was like when he first saw Desdemona and fell in love with her, then Iago’s attempt to get him to distrust her is meaningless. Unless the temptation to see her as deceptive is posed against an earlier honeymoon period, it has no meaning. When you live perpetually slightly ahead of the present, never bonding, never settling down, never letting yourself be penetrated—even by experience let alone memories to hang onto—you are a digital bit of information to be formed into anything. You volunteered for it!</p>
