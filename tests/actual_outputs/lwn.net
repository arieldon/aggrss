		[description] &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.darktable.org/2023/12/darktable-4.6.0-released/&quot;&gt;Version
4.6.0&lt;/a&gt; of the darktable photo editor has been released.  Changes include
a new &quot;rgb primaries&quot; module that &quot;&lt;q&gt;can be used for delicate color
corrections as well as creative color grading&lt;/q&gt;&quot;, enhancements to the
sigmoid module, some performance improvements, and more.  (LWN &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/881853/&quot;&gt;looked at darktable&lt;/a&gt; in 2022).

		[title] The 6.7 kernel will be released on January 7

		[description] Unsurprisingly, Linus Torvalds has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/CAHk-=whceLbGZwuLnR0S3V_ajedDXj=s86sm89m+VT2YrbG1NA@mail.gmail.com/&quot;&gt;let
it be known&lt;/a&gt; that he will do a 6.7-rc8 release (rather than 6.7 final)
on December&amp;nbsp;31, thus avoiding opening the 6.8 merge window on New
Year's Day.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	Just FYI - my current plan is that -rc7 will happen this Saturday
	(because I still follow the Finnish customs of Christmas _Eve_
	being the important day, so Sunday I'll be off), and then if
	anything comes in that week - which it will do, even if networking
	might be offline - I'll do an rc8 the week after.
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, unless anything odd happens, the final 6.7 release will be Jan
	7th, and so the merge window for 6.8 will open Jan 8th.

		[title] [$] Data-type profiling for perf

		[description] Tooling for profiling the effects of memory usage and layout has always
lagged behind that for profiling processor activity, so Namhyung Kim's &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/954938/&quot;&gt;patch set for data-type profiling
in perf&lt;/a&gt; is a welcome addition.  It provides aggregated breakdowns of
memory accesses by data type that can inform structure layout and access
pattern changes.  Existing tools have either, like &lt;a
href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/sdk/heaptrack&quot;&gt;heaptrack&lt;/a&gt;, focused on
profiling allocations, or, like &lt;tt&gt;perf mem&lt;/tt&gt;, on accounting memory
accesses only at the address level.  This new work builds on the latter,
using DWARF debugging information to correlate memory operations with their
source-level types.

		[title] Announcing `async fn` and return-position `impl Trait` in traits (Rust Blog)
		[link] https://lwn.net/Articles/955925/

		[description] The Rust Blog &lt;a
href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html&quot;&gt;announces&lt;/a&gt;
the stabilization of a couple of trait features aimed at improving support
for &lt;tt&gt;async&lt;/tt&gt; code:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	Ever since the stabilization of RFC #1522 in Rust 1.26, Rust has
	allowed users to write &lt;tt&gt;impl Trait&lt;/tt&gt; as the return type of
	functions (often called &quot;RPIT&quot;). This means that the function
	returns &quot;some type that implements &lt;tt&gt;Trait&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. This is
	commonly used to return closures, iterators, and other types that
	are complex or impossible to write explicitly. [...]
&lt;p&gt;
	Starting in Rust 1.75, you can use return-position &lt;tt&gt;impl
	Trait&lt;/tt&gt; in trait (RPITIT) definitions and in trait impls. For
	example, you could use this to write a trait method that returns an
	iterator: [...]
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does all of this have to do with async functions? Well,
	async functions are &quot;just sugar&quot; for functions that return
	&lt;tt&gt;-&amp;gt; impl Future&lt;/tt&gt;. Since these are now permitted in
	traits, &lt;b&gt;we also permit you to write traits that use &lt;tt&gt;async fn&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		[description] Yet another year has come to an end.  Much to our dismay, 2023 did not, in
fact, happen exactly as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/918790/&quot;&gt;predicted back in
January&lt;/a&gt;.  So it seems that, once again, we will have to go through the
process of looking at the predictions that we made and mocking each in
turn, before getting into what was missed altogether.  A lot happened in
2023, not all of which was predictable.

		[description] The 2024 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit will
be held May&amp;nbsp;13 to&amp;nbsp;15 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.  The &lt;a

for proposals&lt;/a&gt; has already gone out, with a deadline of March&amp;nbsp;1.
&quot;&lt;q&gt;LSF/MM/BPF is an invitation-only technical workshop to map out
improvements to the Linux storage, filesystem, BPF, and memory management
subsystems that will make their way into the mainline kernel within the
coming years.&lt;/q&gt;&quot;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/955819/&quot;&gt;4.14.334&lt;/a&gt;
stable kernel updates have all been released; each contains another set of
important fixes.

is already in the review process, with a due date of December&amp;nbsp;22.  It
consists almost exclusively of ksmbd patches in a flurry of backporting
that was seemingly inspired by the recent &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2023121841-register-nutshell-9d6d@gregkh/&quot;&gt;marking
of ksmbd as broken in 5.15&lt;/a&gt;.

		[title] [$] The Linux graphics stack in a nutshell, part 1

		[description] Linux graphics developers often speak of &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; Linux graphics
when they refer to  a number of individual software components and how they
interact 
with each other.
Among other things, it's a mix of kernel-managed display resources, 
Wayland for compositing, accelerated 3D rendering, and decidedly not X11.
In a two-part series, we will take a fast-paced journey
through the graphics code to see how it converts application data
to pixel data and displays it on the screen. In this installment, we look
at application rendering, Mesa internals, and the
necessary kernel features.

		[description] &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/fac431e499f4d173@cvs.openbsd.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSSH
9.6&lt;/a&gt; has been released.  It includes some minor improvements and a fix
for the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrapin-attack.com/&quot;&gt;Terrapin
attack&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
   is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
   consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
   the protocol prevents user authentication from proceeding and
   results in a stuck connection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
